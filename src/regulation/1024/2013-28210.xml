If the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> documents provide for lower cushion limits, then the terms of the loan documents apply.

Where the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> documents do not specifically establish an <ref target="1024-17-b-EscrowAccount" reftype="term">escrow account</ref>, whether a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> may establish an <ref target="1024-17-b-EscrowAccount" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> for the loan is a matter for determination by other Federal or <ref target="1024-2-b-State" reftype="term">state</ref> law.

In such cases, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> shall estimate the borrower's payments for a full cycle of disbursements.

This form is to be used as a statement of actual charges and adjustments paid by the borrower and the seller, to be given to the parties in connection with the settlement. The instructions for completion of the HUD-1 are primarily for the benefit of the settlement agents who prepare the statements and need not be transmitted to the parties as an integral part of the HUD-1.

            <content>Comments: A and B are violating section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref>. Here, A's clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a “title agent” is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services for which he assumes liability, and which includes at a minimum, the evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the <ref target="1024-2-b-TitleCompany" reftype="term">title company</ref>. A may not be compensated for the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the referral of <ref target="1024-2-b-SettlementService" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> business, it has violated section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref>.</content>

The payment of a commission by C to B is not a violation of section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref> if the amount of the commission constitutes reasonable compensation for the services performed by B for C. The payment of a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners, such arrangements would violate section 8. The exemption for controlled business arrangements would not be available because the payments here would not be considered returns on ownership interests.

A request for an official interpretation shall be in writing and addressed to the Associate Director, Research, Markets, and Regulations, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552. A request shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts concerning the issue, including copies of all pertinent documents.

            <content>Rules of construction. (a) Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including, but not limited to,” “among other things,” “for example,” or “such as.”

            <content>Comment designations. Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that the comment interprets.

For example, some of the comments to § <ref target="1024-37-c-1" reftype="internal">1024.37(c)(1)</ref> are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment <ref target="1024-37-c-1-i-Interp-1" reftype="internal">37(c)(1)(i)-1</ref>.

For example, if a borrower makes a monthly payment in February for a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>, but asserts an <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> relating to the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>'s acceptance of the February payment, § <ref target="1024-35-h" reftype="internal">1024.35(h)</ref> does not alter a borrower's obligation to make a monthly payment that the borrower owes for March. A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>, however, may not require that a borrower make the March payment as a condition for complying with its obligations under § <ref target="1024-35" reftype="internal">1024.35</ref> with respect to the notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> on the February payment.</content>

A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> shall treat the request for information as having been submitted by the borrower.</content>

              <content>Owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to an information request for the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by identifying the person on whose behalf the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> receives payments from the borrower. Although investors or guarantors, including among others the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association, may be exposed to risks related to the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> held by a trust either in connection with an investment in securities issued by the trust or the issuance of a guaranty agreement to the trust, such investors or guarantors are not the owners or assignees of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> solely as a result of their roles as such. In certain circumstances, however, a party such as a guarantor may assume multiple roles for a securitization transaction. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association may act as trustee, master <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>, and guarantor in connection with a securitization transaction in which a trust owns a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> subject to a request. In this example, because the Federal National Mortgage Association is the trustee of the trust that owns the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>, a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by providing the name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association as the trustee. The following examples identify the owner or assignee for different forms of <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> ownership:</content>

In general, in a securitization transaction, a special purpose vehicle, such as a trust, is the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. Thus, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> receives the borrower's payments on behalf of the trust. If a securitization transaction is structured such that a trust is the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> and the trust is administered by an appointed trustee, a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by providing the borrower with the name of the trust and the name, address, and appropriate contract information for the trustee.
