                <analysisParagraph>Section 1003.2 of Regulation C sets forth definitions that are used in the regulation. As discussed below, the Bureau proposed both substantive revisions to several definitions and technical revisions to § 1003.2 to enumerate the terms defined therein. The Bureau addresses comments concerning its proposed substantive revisions below. The Bureau received no comments opposing its proposal to enumerate the terms in § 1003.2, and the final rule sets forth enumerations for all such terms. The Bureau believes that this technical revision will facilitate compliance with Regulation C by making defined terms easier to locate and cross-reference in the regulation, commentary, and the procedures published by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisSection>
                  <title>2(b)(1) In General</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Section 1003.2 currently defines an application as an oral or written request for a home purchase loan, a home improvement loan, or a refinancing that is made in accordance with the procedures used by a financial institution for the type of credit requested. The Bureau proposed to make technical corrections and minor wording changes to conform the definition of application to the proposed changes in transactional coverage. In addition, the Bureau proposed to make technical and minor wording changes to the applicable commentary. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(b)(1) and the associated commentary as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally addressed aspects of the definition of application that differ from other regulations or challenges in applying the definition in multifamily and commercial lending. The Bureau received several comments urging that the Regulation C definition of application should be aligned with the definition used in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(3)(ii) to simplify compliance across regulations. As the Bureau noted in the proposed rule, the Bureau did not propose to align the definitions because they serve different purposes.<footnote ref="87">79 FR 51731, 51746 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            The definition of application in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(3)(ii) establishes a clear rule for triggering when disclosures must be provided. In contrast, the definition for Regulation C is closely related to Regulation B and serves HMDA's fair lending purposes by requiring information about the disposition of credit requests received by financial institutions that do not lead to originations.<footnote ref="88">12 CFR 1003.2, comment Application-1; 12 CFR 1002.2(f).</footnote>
            Therefore it is important for the Regulation C definition of application to be based on the procedures used by the financial institution for the type of credit requested rather than the defined elements of the definition in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(3)(ii) under which creditors may be sequencing and structuring their information collection processes in various different ways.<footnote ref="89">78 FR 79730, 79767 (Dec. 31, 2013).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some comments argued that the definition of application would be difficult to comply with for multifamily loans, which generally involve a more fluid application process. They also argued that the Bureau should exclude “pitch book requests” from the definition of application. Pitch book requests are preliminary investment packages related to multifamily residential structures requesting specific loans terms. The Bureau has considered the comments but believes that changes to the proposed definition of application related to multifamily loans are not warranted. Because the definition of application in Regulation C is closely related to the Regulation B definition of application and Regulation B applies to business credit, including multifamily lending,<footnote ref="90">12 CFR 1002.2(j), comment 2(j)-1.</footnote>
            the Bureau believes that the flexible definition of application as proposed and the commentary in Regulation B and Regulation C provide adequate guidance for multifamily lending. The Bureau is also concerned that an exception for pitch book requests may be difficult to adopt because financial institutions may have different definitions of pitch book request or procedures for handlings them. The Bureau is not adopting an exclusion specific to pitch book requests, and believes that the existing commentary regarding the definition of application and prequalifications is appropriate.<footnote ref="91">See existing comment Application-2, final comment 2(b)-2.</footnote>
            Whether pitch book requests would be considered applications under Regulation C would depend on how the specific financial institution treated such requests under its application process for covered loans secured by multifamily residential structures under the definition of application in Regulation C. As discussed below, the Bureau is also excluding covered loans secured by multifamily dwellings from the definition of a preapproval program, which may address some of the commenters' concerns. After considering the comments, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(b)(1) and comments 2(b)-1 and 2(b)-2 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(b)(2) Preapproval Programs</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regulation C incorporates certain requests under preapproval programs into the definition of application under § 1003.2. Such programs are only covered if they involve a comprehensive analysis of the creditworthiness of the applicant and include a written commitment for up to a specific amount, subject only to certain limited conditions. The Bureau proposed to make technical and clarifying wording changes to the definition of a preapproval program under § 1003.2(b)(2) and the applicable commentary to add language adapted from additional FAQs regarding preapproval programs that had been provided by the FFIEC.<footnote ref="92">79 FR 51731, 51747 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(b)(2) with modifications to exclude certain types of covered loans from the definition.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Several commenters addressed the Bureau's proposed definition of preapproval programs. Some commenters questioned the value of preapproval reporting or argued that preapproval reporting discourages financial institutions from offering preapproval programs. However, the Bureau is not excluding preapproval requests from Regulation C in this final rule because this information is valuable for fair lending purposes, as it provides visibility into how applicants are treated in an early stage of the lending process.<footnote ref="93">67 FR 7222, 7224 (Feb. 15, 2002); 79 FR 51731, 51747 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            The statute requires lenders to report action taken on applications,<footnote ref="94">HMDA section 303(4).</footnote>
            and the Bureau believes that requests for preapproval as defined in the proposal and final rule represent credit applications. The Bureau does not believe that Regulation C's coverage of preapproval programs has discouraged offering of preapproval programs, and it concludes that any discouragement would be justified by the benefits of reporting. The reporting requirement is limited only to preapproval programs that meet certain conditions. Additionally, the Bureau is finalizing changes to comment 2(b)-3 that specify that programs described as preapproval programs that do not meet the definition in § 1003.2(b)(2) are not preapproval programs for purposes of HMDA reporting.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters requested clarification about occasional preapprovals and some argued for a broader and more flexible definition of preapproval programs. The Bureau is not adopting a broader or more flexible definition of preapproval programs because it believes that limiting the scope of the definition allows for comparison of similar programs across institutions, where a broader definition could expand reportable transactions, lead to new compliance issues, and make preapproval data less comparable across institutions. The Bureau continues to believe that a financial institution that does not have a preapproval program and only occasionally considers preapproval requests on an ad hoc basis need not report those transactions and believes that proposed comment 2(b)-3 addresses the commenters' concerns. It provides, in part, that a financial institution need not treat ad hoc requests as part of a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. The Bureau is therefore finalizing comment 2(b)-3 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>After considering the comments and conducting additional analysis, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(b)(2) generally as proposed, with minor revisions to exclude home purchase loans that will be open-end lines of credit, reverse mortgages, or secured by multifamily dwellings. Some loans secured by multifamily dwellings have been previously reported in HMDA under preapproval programs. The definition of a home purchase loan could include these types of loans. The definition of preapproval programs in current Regulation C and adopted by the final rule is primarily focused on programs associated with closed-end home purchase loans for one- to four-unit dwellings. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to categorically exclude loans secured by multifamily dwellings, open-end lines of credit, and reverse mortgages from the definition of preapproval programs in order to facilitate consistent reporting and analysis of preapprovals by limiting the definition to closed-end home purchase loans for one- to four-unit dwellings.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(d) Closed-End Mortgage Loan</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Under existing Regulation C, financial institutions must report information about applications for, and originations of, closed-end loans made for one of three purposes: Home improvement, home purchase, or refinancing.<footnote ref="95">Reverse mortgages currently are subject to these same criteria for reporting; thus, a closed-end reverse mortgage currently must be reported if it is for one of Regulation C's three purposes.</footnote>
            Closed-end home purchase loans and refinancings must be reported if they are dwelling-secured.<footnote ref="96">Regulation C defines “dwelling” broadly to include single-family homes, rental properties, multifamily residential structures (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; apartment buildings), manufactured homes, and vacation homes. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.2(f) and related commentary.</footnote>
            Closed-end home improvement loans must be reported whether or not they are dwelling-secured.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(e) (“covered loan”), the Bureau proposed to adjust Regulation C's transactional coverage to require financial institutions to report all dwelling-secured loans (and applications), instead of reporting only those loans and applications for the purpose of home improvement, home purchase, or refinancing.<footnote ref="97">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o) and (q), the proposal applied the same dwelling-secured test to open-end lines of credit and reverse mortgages, the two other categories of “covered loans” in proposed § 1003.2(e).</footnote>
            To facilitate this shift in transactional coverage, the Bureau proposed to define the term “closed-end mortgage loan” in Regulation C. Proposed § 1003.2(d) provided that a closed-end mortgage loan was a dwelling-secured debt obligation that was not an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o), a reverse mortgage under § 1003.2(q), or an excluded transaction under § 1003.3(c). The Bureau did not propose commentary to accompany proposed § 1003.2(d) but solicited feedback about whether commentary would be helpful.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The proposal to remove Regulation C's current purpose-based reporting approach for closed-end mortgage loans in some cases broadened, and in some cases limited, the closed-end loans that would be reported under the regulation. For example, the proposal provided for reporting of all closed-end home-equity loans and all closed-end, dwelling-secured commercial-purpose loans. At the same time, the proposal eliminated the requirement to report home improvement loans not secured by a dwelling.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(e), the Bureau is finalizing the proposed shift to dwelling-secured transactional coverage for consumer-purpose transactions and is retaining Regulation C's traditional purpose test for commercial-purpose transactions. The Bureau believes that the shift serves HMDA's purposes, will improve HMDA data, and will simplify transactional reporting requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(d) largely as proposed, but with technical revisions for clarity, to define the universe of closed-end mortgage loans that must be reported under Regulation C unless otherwise excluded under § 1003.3(c). The Bureau also is finalizing commentary to § 1003.2(d) to address questions that commenters raised about the scope of the closed-end mortgage loan definition.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Relatively few commenters specifically addressed the benefits and burdens of reporting all dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose, closed-end mortgage loans.<footnote ref="98">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(e), nearly all commenters addressed in some fashion the Bureau's proposal to shift Regulation C's transactional coverage test from a purpose-based test to a collateral-based test. However, most commenters focused either on the benefits and burdens of the shift overall, or on the specific benefits and burdens of reporting all open-end lines of credit, all reverse mortgages, or all dwelling-secured, commercial-purpose mortgage loans and lines of credit. Those comments are addressed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1003.2(e), (o), (q), and § 1003.3(c)(10), respectively. The section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d) focuses on the comments that specifically addressed the proposal to cover all consumer-purpose, closed-end home-equity loans.</footnote>
            Consumer advocacy group commenters supported the proposal to cover all such loans, and industry stakeholders expressed mixed views. A number of consumer advocacy group commenters also requested that the Bureau clarify in the final rule whether particular categories of transactions are included under the closed-end mortgage loan definition.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisSection>
                    <title>Coverage of Dwelling-Secured, Consumer-Purpose, Closed-End Mortgage Loans</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>A large number of consumer advocacy group and community development commenters supported having information about all closed-end home-equity loans. They stated that having information about all such loans would be valuable in assessing whether neighborhoods that the consumer groups serve, especially those that are low- and moderate-income, are receiving the full range of credit that they need and would be appropriate to ensure an adequate understanding of the mortgage market.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>A small group of industry commenters supported the proposed shift to dwelling-secured coverage to the extent that it meant reporting all dwelling-secured, closed-end, consumer-purpose loans. Some of these commenters argued that reporting all such loans would be less burdensome than discerning whether each loan was for a reportable purpose.<footnote ref="99">One commenter provided a specific example. The commenter stated that, when a borrower owns a home outright but takes out a dwelling-secured debt consolidation loan, the loan is recorded as a refinancing in the lender's loan origination system and on the GSE's standard loan application form. However, the loan currently is not reported under Regulation C because it does not meet the purpose-based test. Therefore, an employee later must remove the transaction manually from the institution's HMDA report. If all dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose, closed-end loans were covered, the transaction would be reported and the extra, manual step of removing the transaction would be unnecessary.</footnote>
            Others asserted that dwelling-secured coverage would eliminate the possibility that exists under current Regulation C of erroneously gathering race, gender, and ethnicity data for consumer-purpose loans that later are determined not to be reportable. One industry commenter supported dwelling-secured coverage only for closed-end, consumer-purpose loans secured by one- to four-unit dwellings, arguing that these transactions are the most common, are similar in their underwriting and in their risks to consumers, and have hit the economy hardest when they default en masse. Other industry commenters agreed that the shift to dwelling-secured coverage for closed-end, consumer-purpose loans was appropriate and would serve HMDA's purposes, would simplify reporting, would improve data for HMDA users, and would better align Regulation C's coverage with Regulations X and Z.<footnote ref="100">Regulation X implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. 2601 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. 1601 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(e), a majority of industry commenters opposed the proposed shift to dwelling-secured coverage, and some of those commenters specifically objected to reporting data about all closed-end home-equity loans. Some argued that the Bureau should maintain current coverage; a few argued that closed-end home-equity loans should be excluded from coverage altogether. The commenters argued that funds obtained through home-equity loans could be used for any purpose. If a transaction's funds were not used for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes, commenters asserted, then having data about that transaction would not serve HMDA's purpose of ensuring that financial institutions are meeting the housing needs of their communities.

            A few commenters also objected that such reporting would increase loan volume or argued that compiling data about all closed-end home-equity loans would be onerous, would require costly systems upgrades, or would distort HMDA data because loans would be reported even if their funds were not used for housing-related purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes that covering all dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose, closed-end mortgage loans will provide useful data that will serve HMDA's purposes by providing additional information about closed-end home-equity loans, which research indicates were a significant factor leading up to the financial crisis,<footnote ref="102">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51747-48 (Aug. 29, 2014) (citing Atif Mian &amp;amp; Amir Sufi, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;House Prices, Home Equity-Based Borrowing, and the U.S. Household Leverage Crisis,&lt;/em&gt; 101 Am.

            The Bureau also believes, as some industry commenters observed, that covering all such transactions will simplify the regulation and ease compliance burden.

                    <title>Clarifications to the Closed-End Mortgage Loan Definition</title>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">General.</em> The Bureau is making two clarifying changes to § 1003.2(d) and is adding comment 2(d)-1 to provide general guidance about the definition of closed-end mortgage loan. First, proposed § 1003.2(d) provided that a closed-end mortgage loan was a dwelling-secured debt obligation that was not an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o), a reverse mortgage under § 1003.2(q), or an excluded transaction under § 1003.3(c). To align with lending practices, to streamline the definitions of closed-end mortgage loan and open-end line of credit, and to streamline the reverse mortgage flag in final § 1003.4(a)(36), the final rule eliminates the mutual exclusivity between closed-end mortgage loans and reverse mortgages.<footnote ref="104">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(q), under the final rule a reverse mortgage thus may be either a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit, as appropriate.</footnote>
            Second, the final rule eliminates the proposed language that provided that an excluded transaction under § 1003.3(c) was not a closed-end mortgage loan. The Bureau is making this change to avoid circularity with final § 1003.3(c), which incorporates for clarity the defined terms “closed-end mortgage loan” and “open-end line of credit” into the descriptions of excluded transactions. Final § 1003.2(d) thus provides that a closed-end mortgage loan is a dwelling-secured extension of credit that is not an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o). Comment 2(d)-1 provides an example of a loan that is not a closed-end mortgage loan because it is not dwelling-secured.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Extension of credit and loan modifications.</em> As proposed, § 1003.2(d) generally provided that a closed-end mortgage loan was a dwelling-secured “debt obligation.” Many consumer advocacy group commenters asked the Bureau to clarify the scope of transactions covered under the term “debt obligation.” In particular, a large number of consumer advocacy group commenters asked the Bureau to require reporting of all loan modifications.<footnote ref="105">These comments related to loan workout modifications. Several commenters also addressed coverage of loan consolidation, extension, and modification agreements. Those comments are discussed separately, below.</footnote>
            The commenters argued that financial institutions' performance in modifying loans is and will continue to be a major factor in determining whether they are meeting local housing needs, particularly the needs of communities that have been devastated by the mortgage crisis. The commenters also argued that financial institutions' loan modification performance will be a major factor in determining whether they are complying with fair housing and fair lending laws. Specifically, commenters cited several studies showing that, since the mortgage crisis, borrowers of color, or borrowers who live in communities of color or in low-to-moderate income communities, have received less favorable loss mitigation outcomes than white borrowers. Commenters stated that many millions of loan modifications have been made since the mortgage crisis, and millions more will be made in the coming years. Commenters argued that the need for data about loan modifications is compelling given the volume of transactions, the identified fair lending concerns, and the lack of other publicly available data about them.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As several of these commenters noted, however, loan modifications currently are not reported because they are not “originations” under existing Regulation C. Indeed, since its adoption, Regulation C has required reporting only of applications, originations, and purchases, and the proposal did not seek to change this. While there is a need for publicly available data about loan modifications, the final rule does not require reporting of loan modifications. Covering all loan modifications would be a complex undertaking and would constitute a major revision of Regulation C. However, the Bureau has no information about the burdens to financial institutions of reporting loan modifications under Regulation C, and the Bureau neither has proposed, nor has received feedback about, how existing data points would need to be modified, or whether additional data points would be required, to accommodate reporting of loan modifications.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>After considering the comments, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(d) to provide that a “closed-end mortgage loan” is a dwelling-secured “extension of credit” that is not an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o). Comment 2(d)-2 provides guidance about “extension of credit.” First, comment 2(d)-2 provides an example of a transaction that is not a closed-end mortgage loan because no credit is extended. Comment 2(d)-2 also explains that, for purposes of Regulation C, an “extension of credit” refers to the granting of credit pursuant to a new debt obligation. If a transaction modifies, renews, extends, or amends the terms of an existing debt obligation without satisfying and replacing the original debt obligation with a new debt obligation, the transaction generally is not an extension of credit under Regulation C.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that it is interpreting the phrase “extension of credit” differently in § 1003.2(d) than in Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002, which implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).<footnote ref="106">15 U.S.C. 1691 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            Regulation B defines “extension of credit” under § 1002.2(q) to include the granting of credit in any form, including the renewal of credit and the continuance of existing credit in some circumstances. As discussed above, the Bureau generally is interpreting the phrase “extension of credit” in § 1003.2(d) to refer at this time only to the granting of credit pursuant to a new debt obligation. The Bureau may in the future revisit whether it is appropriate to require loan modifications to be reported under Regulation C.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Exceptions to “extension of credit” rule.</em> As discussed below, comments 2(d)-2.i and .ii provide two narrow exceptions to the general rule that an “extension of credit” under the final rule occurs only when a new debt obligation is created. One exception addresses assumptions, which Regulation C historically has covered. The second addresses transactions completed pursuant to New York consolidation, extension, and modification agreements (New York CEMAs). As discussed below, the Bureau believes that both assumptions and transactions completed pursuant to New York CEMAs represent situations where a new debt obligation is created in substance, if not in form, and that the benefits of requiring such transactions to be reported justify the burdens.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Assumptions.</em> The final rule adds new comment 2(d)-2.i to address Regulation C's coverage of assumptions. Under existing comment 1(c)-9, assumptions are reportable transactions. Existing comment 1(c)-9 provides that assumptions occur when an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower as the obligor on an existing obligation. Existing comment 1(c)-9 also provides that assumptions are reportable as home purchase loans. The Bureau proposed to move existing comment 1(c)-9 to the commentary to the definition of home purchase loan, and the Bureau is finalizing that comment, with certain modifications, as comment 2(j)-5. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(j).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the final rule's continued coverage of assumptions, the Bureau is adding comment 2(d)-2.i to the definition of closed-end mortgage loan to clarify that an assumption is an “extension of credit” under Regulation C even though the new borrower assumes an existing debt obligation. When the Board first clarified Regulation C's application to assumptions, it stated that, when an institution expressly agrees in writing with a new party to accept that party as the obligor on an existing home purchase loan, the transaction should be treated as a new home purchase loan.<footnote ref="107">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 53 FR 31683, 31685 (Aug. 19, 1988).</footnote>
            The Bureau agrees and final comment 2(d)-2.i thus provides that assumptions are considered “extensions of credit” even if the new borrower assumes an existing debt obligation.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Comment 2(d)-2.i also addresses successor-in-interest transactions. A successor-in-interest transaction is a transaction in which an individual first succeeds the prior owner as the property owner and afterward seeks to take on the debt secured by the property. One industry association recommended that the Bureau exclude successor-in-interest transactions from Regulation C's definition of assumption. The comment noted that the Bureau recently published interpretive guidance under Regulation Z stating that successor-in-interest transactions are not assumptions under that regulation because the successor already owns the property when the debt is assumed.<footnote ref="108">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 41631 (July 17, 2014).</footnote>
            The comment argued that successor-in-interest transactions should be treated the same under Regulations C and Z.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is clarifying in comment 2(d)-2.i that successor-in-interest transactions are assumptions under Regulation C. The Bureau's interpretive guidance providing that successor-in-interest transactions are not assumptions under Regulation Z relies on Regulation Z's existing definition of assumption in § 1026.2(a)(24), which provides that the new transaction must be a residential mortgage transaction, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a transaction to finance the acquisition or initial construction of the dwelling being financed. Successor-in-interest transactions do not fit Regulation Z's definition because no dwelling is being acquired or constructed.<footnote ref="109">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 41633 (&amp;#8220;Although [successor-in-interest] transactions are commonly referred to as assumptions, they are not assumptions under &amp;#167; 1026.20(b) because the transaction is not a residential mortgage transaction as to the successor.&amp;#8221;)</footnote>
            In contrast, Regulation C's definition of assumption requires only that a new borrower be accepted as the obligor on an existing obligation. Successor-in-interest transactions fit Regulation C's definition.<footnote ref="110">Consistent with Regulation Z's interpretive guidance, however, final comment 2(j)-5 provides that successor-in-interest transactions are not home purchase loans under § 1003.2(j).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Moreover, when the Bureau issued its Regulation Z interpretive guidance, it was concerned that subjecting successor-in-interest transactions to an ability-to-repay analysis could decrease the frequency of such transactions, which could harm successors inheriting homes after, for example, a family member's death. The Bureau does not believe that similar concerns apply to requiring such transactions to be reported under Regulation C. On the contrary, the Bureau believes that collecting information about successor-in-interest transactions under Regulation C will help to monitor for discrimination in such transactions. Comment 2(d)-2.i thus specifies that successor-in-interest transactions are assumptions under Regulation C. Like assumptions generally, successor-in-interest transactions represent an exception to the general rule that an “extension of credit” requires a new debt obligation. As noted, the Bureau believes that assumptions, including successor-in-interest transactions, represent new debt obligations in substance, if not in form, and should be reported as such.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisSection>
                    <title>Consolidation, Extension, and Modification Agreements</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>Several consumer advocacy group commenters stated that it was unclear whether the proposal covered transactions completed pursuant to modification, extension, and consolidation agreements (MECAs) or consolidation, extension, and modification agreements (CEMAs). They asked the Bureau to specify that MECAs/CEMAs are reportable transactions. As noted below, Regulation C's commentary at one time specified that MECAs/CEMAs were not reportable as refinancings, and this guidance currently exists in an FFIEC FAQ. Some uncertainty has remained, however, about the reportability of MECAs/CEMAs used for home purchase or home improvement purposes. For the reasons discussed below, the final rule clarifies that CEMAs completed pursuant to section 255 of the New York Tax Law are covered loans. Other MECA/CEMA transactions are not covered loans under the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>New York CEMAs are loans secured by dwellings located in New York State. They generally are used in place of traditional refinancings, either to amend a transaction's interest rate or loan term, or to permit a borrower to take cash out. However, unlike in traditional refinancings, the existing debt obligation is not “satisfied and replaced.” Instead, the existing obligation is consolidated into a new loan, either by the same or a different lender, and either with or without new funds being added to the existing loan balance. Under New York State law, if no new money is added during the transaction, there is no “new” mortgage, and the borrower avoids paying the mortgage recording taxes that would have been imposed if a traditional refinancing had been used and the original obligation had been satisfied and replaced. If new money is part of the consolidated loan, the borrower pays mortgage recording taxes only on the new money.<footnote ref="111">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; N.Y. Tax Law &amp;#167; 255 (Consol. 2015).</footnote>

            While generally used in place of traditional refinancings, New York CEMAs also can be used for home purchases (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> to complete an assumption), where the seller and buyer agree that the buyer will assume the seller's outstanding principal balance, and that balance is consolidated with a new loan to the borrower for the remainder of the purchase price.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>A number of consumer advocacy group commenters stated that the Bureau should include MECAs/CEMAs, particularly New York CEMAs, as reportable transactions under the dwelling-secured coverage scheme. These commenters stated that New York CEMAs very often are used in lieu of traditional refinance loans, especially for larger-dollar, multifamily apartment building loans, which are central to maintaining the stock of private affordable housing complexes. The commenters argued that, without New York CEMA data, it is difficult or impossible to know where and how much credit banks are extending for such residential buildings, and whether the credit is extended on equitable terms. The commenters noted that CEMAs optionally are reported under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) but that CRA reporting provides less data to the public or to policymakers than if the transactions were HMDA-reportable.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>These commenters also stated that HMDA reporters historically have experienced confusion about whether to report MECAs/CEMAs. Under Regulation C's traditional loan-purpose coverage scheme, the Board declined to extend coverage to MECAs/CEMAs, because the Board found that the transactions did not meet the definition of a refinancing (because the existing debt obligation was not satisfied and replaced). The Board determined that maintaining a bright-line “satisfies and replaces” rule for refinancings was preferable to revising the definition to a “functional equivalent” test that would cover MECAs/CEMAs but that also would introduce uncertainty about whether other types of transactions should be reported as refinancings.<footnote ref="112">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 59 FR 63698, 63702 (Dec. 9, 1994); 65 FR 78656 (Dec. 15, 2000); 67 FR 7222, 7227 (Feb. 15, 2002). In 1995, the Board adopted commentary to clarify that MECAs/CEMAs were not reportable as refinancings. 60 FR 63393 (Dec. 11, 1995). This commentary later was dropped from Regulation C inadvertently, but it was retained in an FFIEC FAQ.</footnote>
            Because the Board's guidance concerning MECAs/CEMAs was limited to refinancings, however, it appears that at least some financial institutions have reported MECAs/CEMAs as home improvement loans when the transactions involved new money for home improvement purposes, or as home purchase loans when the transactions were the functional equivalent of traditional assumptions.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The various consumer advocacy group commenters that addressed MECAs/CEMAs asserted that the proposal did not resolve the uncertainty that has existed about whether to report these transactions. Proposed § 1003.2(d) provided that all closed-end, dwelling-secured “debt obligations” were reportable transactions, and “debt obligations” arguably would include MECAs/CEMAs. At the same time, however, the proposal retained Regulation C's existing definition of “refinancing,” which arguably would continue to exclude MECAs/CEMAs from coverage or would make it unclear how such transactions should be reported.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concludes that having data about New York CEMAs, in particular, will improve HMDA data. These transactions are used regularly in New York in place of traditional refinancings and sometimes in place of traditional home purchase loans. New York CEMAs are used not only for multifamily dwellings, but also for single-family transactions in high-cost areas like New York City. While it is difficult to identify precisely how often New York CEMAs are used, industry professionals familiar with the New York CEMA market believe that the transactions are used on a daily basis in New York State and represent a significant percentage of the refinancings that occur in the State. Requiring reporting of New York CEMAs will improve HMDA data and also will resolve lingering confusion about how Regulation C applies to them. Finally, the change is consistent with the shift to dwelling-secured coverage for most transactions.<footnote ref="113">The Bureau understands that MECAs/CEMAs may be used in States other than New York. However, based on the comments received and the Bureau's own research, it appears that CEMAs are particularly common in New York State. As noted elsewhere in this section-by-section analysis, the Bureau understands that, by requiring reporting of New York CEMAs, it is departing from the Board's historical guidance on this topic. The Bureau believes that such a departure is warranted based on the apparent frequency with which such transactions are used. Like the Board, however, the Bureau believes that the benefits of modifying the overall “satisfies and replaces” standard for refinancings to capture MECAs/CEMAs do not justify the burdens of such a change. Therefore, the Bureau is incorporating New York CEMAs into the final rule by referencing the specific provision of the New York Tax Code that permits them. If the Bureau becomes aware of CEMAs/MECAs being completed in significant numbers in other States, the Bureau may evaluate whether it would be practicable to require them to be reported in a similar manner.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Like assumptions, New York CEMAs represent an exception to the general rule that an “extension of credit” requires a new debt obligation. However, the Bureau believes that New York CEMAs represent new debt obligations in substance, if not in form, and should be reported as such. The Bureau acknowledges that, by requiring reporting of New York CEMAs, it is departing from the Board's historical guidance that such transactions need not be reported. The Bureau believes that the benefits of this departure justify the burdens both for the reasons discussed above and because the Bureau is defining the scope of transactions to be reported narrowly to encompass only those transactions that fall within the scope of New York Tax Law section 255.<footnote ref="114">Under the final rule, MECAs/CEMAs completed in States other than New York are not reported, regardless of whether they are used for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes, and regardless of whether new money is extended as part of the transaction.</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that limiting the scope of reportable MECAs/CEMAs to those covered by New York Tax Law section 255 will permit New York CEMAs to be reported while avoiding the confusion that, as the Board worried, could result from departing from a bright-line “satisfies and replaces” rule for the definition of refinancings generally.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>After considering the comments received, the Bureau is adopting new comment 2(d)-2.ii, specifying that a transaction completed pursuant to a New York CEMA and classified as a supplemental mortgage under N.Y. Tax Law § 255, such that the borrower owed reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, is an extension of credit under § 1003.2(d). To avoid any implication that other types of loan modifications or extensions must be reported, the commentary language is narrowly tailored to require reporting only of transactions completed pursuant to this specific provision of New York law. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(i), (j), and (p) for details about whether a New York CEMA is a home improvement loan, a home purchase loan, or a refinancing.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(e) Covered Loan</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>HMDA requires financial institutions to collect and report information about “mortgage loans,” which HMDA section 303(2) defines as loans secured by residential real property or home improvement loans. When the Board adopted Regulation C, it implemented this requirement by mandating that financial institutions report information about applications and closed-end loans made for one of three purposes: Home improvement, home purchase, or refinancing.<footnote ref="115">41 FR 23931, 23932 (June 14, 1976).</footnote>
            As noted, under existing Regulation C, closed-end home purchase loans and refinancings must be reported if they are dwelling-secured, and closed-end home improvement loans must be reported whether or not they are dwelling-secured.<footnote ref="116">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.2(d), (f), (i).</footnote>
            For transactions that meet one of the three purposes, reporting of closed-end loans is mandatory and reporting of home-equity lines of credit is optional.<footnote ref="117">Specifically, under existing § 1003.4(c)(3), financial institutions optionally may report home-equity lines of credit made in whole or in part for the purpose of home improvement or home purchase.</footnote>
            Under existing Regulation C, reverse mortgages are subject to these same criteria for reporting: A closed-end reverse mortgage must be reported if it is for one of the three purposes; a reverse mortgage that is an open-end line of credit is optionally reported.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>To simplify Regulation C's transactional coverage test and to expand the types of transactions reported, the Bureau proposed to require financial institutions to report applications for, and originations and purchases of, all dwelling-secured loans and lines of credit. The Bureau also proposed to add the defined term “covered loan” in § 1003.2(e). The term referred to all transactions reportable under the proposed dwelling-secured coverage scheme: Closed-end mortgage loans under proposed § 1003.2(d), open-end lines of credit under proposed § 1003.2(o), and reverse mortgages under proposed § 1003.2(q). The term provided a shorthand phrase that HMDA reporters and data users could use to refer to any transaction reportable under Regulation C. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing in § 1003.2(e) the defined term “covered loan” and the shift to dwelling-secured coverage largely as proposed for consumer-purpose loans and lines of credit. The Bureau is retaining Regulation C's existing purpose-based test for commercial-purpose loans and lines of credit.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Only a few commenters specifically addressed the Bureau's proposal to add the defined term “covered loan” to Regulation C to refer to all covered transactions, and the commenters generally favored the proposal. They believed that having a standard shorthand for all covered transactions would facilitate compliance. The Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(e) “covered loan” to define the universe of transactions covered under Regulation C.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A large number of commenters addressed the proposed shift from purpose-based to collateral-based transactional coverage, with consumer advocacy group commenters supporting the shift and industry commenters expressing mixed views.<footnote ref="118">This section-by-section analysis provides a high-level discussion of comments concerning the proposed shift to dwelling-secured coverage. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analyses of &amp;#167; 1003.2(d), (i), (o), (q) and of &amp;#167; 1003.3(c)(10) for specific comments concerning closed-end mortgage loans, home improvement loans, open-end lines of credit, reverse mortgages, and commercial-purpose transactions, respectively.</footnote>

            Some consumer advocacy groups stated that having information about all loans secured by residential property would improve the usefulness and quality of HMDA data. Others stated that having data about all such loans would be valuable in assessing whether financial institutions are providing the neighborhoods that the consumer advocacy groups serve with the full range of credit the neighborhoods need. One consumer advocacy commenter asserted that financial institutions should report any transaction that could result in a borrower losing his or her home. Another stated that removing the subjectivity from determining whether to report a loan would ease burden for financial institutions, and that having information about more loans would improve HMDA's usefulness. The commenter noted that consumer mortgage lending products evolve rapidly, and there is no principled reason to require reporting of some but not others.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and a group of State regulators expressed mixed views about the proposed shift to dwelling-secured coverage. A small number of industry commenters supported the proposal unconditionally because they believed that it would ease burden. These commenters, who generally were smaller financial institutions and compliance consultants, stated that deciding which loans meet the current purpose test is confusing. They stated that a simplified transactional coverage test would stop the erroneous over-reporting of loans that has occurred despite financial institutions' best efforts,<footnote ref="119">These commenters seemed to be concerned about erroneously classifying consumer-purpose transactions as HMDA-reportable and, in turn, unnecessarily collecting race, sex, and ethnicity data from applicants and borrowers.</footnote>
            and that the benefits of a streamlined test justified the burdens of more reporting. One industry commenter appreciated the fact that HMDA would provide a more comprehensive view of mortgage transactions across the country. A group of State regulators supported dwelling-secured coverage for consumer-purpose transactions only.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The majority of industry commenters that addressed transactional coverage opposed the proposed shift to dwelling-secured coverage, supported it only for consumer-purpose transactions or for closed-end mortgage loans, or supported it only to the extent that it would eliminate reporting of home improvement loans not secured by a dwelling. Numerous industry commenters generally objected to the overall compliance burdens and costs of reporting additional transactions, particularly in light of the Bureau's proposal simultaneously to expand the data reported about each transaction and to lower (for some institutions) the institutional coverage threshold.<footnote ref="120">A number of commenters argued that, in light of the Bureau's proposal to expand transactional coverage, the Bureau should modify its institutional coverage threshold proposal. Those comments are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g).</footnote>
            One government agency commenter expressed concern that the revisions to transactional coverage would burden small financial institutions and urged the Bureau not to adopt the proposed changes. Some industry commenters generally asserted that their reportable transaction volume would increase significantly,<footnote ref="121">Many commenters discussed the overall increase in reporting from a shift to dwelling-secured coverage. Others estimated only the increase from particular categories of transactions, such as home-equity lines of credit or commercial-purpose transactions. Those estimates are discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1003.2(o) and of § 1003.3(c)(10).</footnote>
            that they would not be able to comply without hiring additional staff, and that compliance costs would be passed to consumers. Others generally argued that the Bureau should keep Regulation C's existing purpose-based coverage because it serves HMDA's purposes better than a collateral-based scheme. Most industry commenters that opposed the proposed shift, however, specifically objected to the burdens of reporting all home-equity lines of credit and all dwelling-secured commercial-purpose loans and lines of credit.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As explained in the section-by-section analyses of § 1003.2(d) and (o), the Bureau is finalizing the shift to dwelling-secured coverage for closed- and open-end consumer-purpose transactions, with some modifications to ease burden for open-end reporting. After considering the comments received, and as discussed fully in the section-by-section analyses of those sections, the Bureau believes that the benefits of expanded reporting justify the burdens. As discussed in the section-by-section of § 1003.3(c)(10), however, the Bureau is maintaining Regulation C's existing purpose-based coverage test for commercial-purpose transactions.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(f) Dwelling</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to revise the definition of dwelling in § 1003.2 by moving the geographic location requirement currently in the definition of dwelling to § 1003.1(c), to add additional examples of dwellings to the definition and commentary, and to revise the commentary to exclude certain structures from the definition of dwelling. A few commenters supported the proposed changes to the definition of dwelling, while others argued that certain types of structures should be included or excluded from the definition. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(f) with minor technical revisions to the definition and with additional revisions to the commentary discussed in detail below. The definition is revised to clarify that multifamily residential structures include complexes and manufactured home communities.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters argued that second homes and investment properties should no longer be covered by Regulation C and that only primary residences should be reported because second homes and investment properties do not relate to housing needs in the same way that primary residences do. HMDA section 303(2) defines a mortgage loan, in part, as one secured by “residential real property” and HMDA section 304(b)(2) requires collection of information regarding “mortgagors who did not, at the time of execution of the mortgage, intend to reside in the property securing the mortgage loan.” The Bureau believes that second homes as well as investment properties are within the scope of information required by HMDA and should continue to be covered by Regulation C. The Bureau is therefore finalizing comment 2(f)-1 generally as proposed, with certain material from proposed comment 2(f)-1 incorporated into comment 2(f)-2 as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters argued that all multifamily properties should be excluded from Regulation C. The Bureau believes that multifamily residential structures should continue to be included within Regulation C because they provide for housing needs and because, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, HMDA data highlight the importance of multifamily lending to the recovering housing finance market and to consumers.<footnote ref="122">79 FR 51731, 51800 (Aug. 29, 2014); San Francisco Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 42.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many commenters addressed multifamily loan reporting in more specific ways. Some commenters supported the proposal's coverage of manufactured home community loans and other aspects related to multifamily lending. Others requested guidance on reporting multifamily transactions. Some commenters argued that certain types of multifamily lending should be excluded from Regulation C. The Bureau is adopting new comment 2(f)-2 dealing specifically with multifamily residential structures and communities, which incorporates certain material from proposed comment 2(f)-1 and additional material in response to comments. The Bureau believes that providing a specific comment relating to multifamily residential structures will facilitate compliance by providing guidance on when loans related to multifamily dwellings would be considered loans secured by a dwelling for purposes of Regulation C. The comment provides that a manufactured home community is a dwelling for purposes of Regulation C regardless of whether any individual manufactured homes also secure the loan. The comment also provides examples of loans related to certain multifamily structures that would nevertheless not be secured by a dwelling for purposes of Regulation C, and would therefore not be reportable, such as loans secured only by an assignment of rents or dues or only by common areas and not individual dwelling units.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 2(f)-3 relating to exclusions from the definition of dwelling (incorporating material from proposed comment 2(f)-2) and clarifying that recreational vehicle parks are excluded from the definition of dwelling for purposes of Regulation C. Several commenters agreed with the proposed exclusions for recreational vehicles, houseboats, mobile homes constructed prior to June 15, 1976 (pre-1976 mobile homes),<footnote ref="123">The HUD standards for manufactured homes do not cover mobile homes constructed before June 15, 1976. 24 CFR 3282.8(a). 79 FR 51731, 51749 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            and other types of structures.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regarding the exclusion of recreational vehicles, the Bureau agrees with the commenters that supported the proposed clarification that recreational vehicles are not dwellings for purposes of Regulation C, regardless of whether they are used as residences. As noted in the proposal, the Bureau believes that making this exclusion explicit will provide more clarity on what structures qualify as dwellings and reduce burden on financial institutions. The Bureau also believes it will improve the consistency of reported HMDA data. Clarifying that recreational vehicle parks are excluded from the definition of dwelling for purposes of Regulation C is consistent with the exclusion of recreational vehicles. The Bureau believes that, as discussed above, while manufactured home communities should be included in the definition of dwelling for purposes of Regulation C, including recreational vehicle parks would not be appropriate given that they are not frequently intended as long-term housing.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters stated that the proposed exclusion of pre-1976 mobile homes would create compliance problems because the financial institution could mistakenly collect race, ethnicity, and sex information before knowing whether the home was a manufactured home and therefore violate Regulation B. The Bureau believes that this concern is unlikely to result in ECOA violations because Regulation B would still require collection of demographic information on some pre-1976 mobile home lending.<footnote ref="124">12 CFR 1002.13(a)(2).</footnote>
            Other commenters argued that pre-1976 mobile home lending should be reported under Regulation C because of consumer protection and housing needs concerns related to this type of housing. The Bureau does not believe this concern justifies the additional burden of requiring financial institutions to report these loans and identify them distinctly from manufactured home loans, especially given that the amount of lending secured by this type of collateral will continue to decrease as time passes. Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing the exclusion of pre-1976 mobile homes as part of comment 2(f)-3. Clarifying that recreational vehicle parks are excluded from the definition of dwelling for purposes of Regulation C is consistent with the exclusion of recreational vehicles.<footnote ref="125">As discussed in the proposal, the final rule's definition of dwelling would differ from Regulation Z's definition of dwelling with respect to some recreational vehicles, because Regulation Z treats recreational vehicles used as residences as dwellings. 12 CFR part 1026, comment 2(a)(19)-2. 79 FR 51731, 51749 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that, as discussed above, while manufactured home communities should be included in the definition of dwelling for purposes of Regulation C, including recreational vehicle parks would not be appropriate given that they are not frequently intended as long term housing.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed a special rule for mixed-use properties that contained five or more individual dwelling units. The Bureau proposed that such a property always be considered to have a primary residential use and therefore report a covered loan secured by it. A few commenters supported the proposal to report all residential structures with five or more individual dwelling units, but most commenters who addressed mixed-use property argued that this was overbroad and that the current primary use rules should apply to multifamily residential structures as well. The Bureau is revising comment 2(f)-3 relating to mixed-use properties and finalizing it as comment 2(f)-4 by removing the sentence requiring that financial institutions always treat residential structures with five or more individual dwelling units as having a primary residential purpose. Requiring financial institutions to report mixed-use multifamily properties in all circumstances would result in reporting of multifamily properties with relatively small housing components and large commercial components. Data users could not differentiate between those properties and multifamily properties with larger housing components, which would decrease the data's usefulness. Thus retaining the existing discretion for financial institutions to determine the primary use for multifamily properties is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 2(f)-5 relating to properties with medical and service components. Some commenters requested guidance on when properties such as retirement homes, assisted living, and nursing homes should be reported under Regulation C. Other commenters requested exclusions for all properties that provide any service or medical care component. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to exclude all such properties. Information about loans secured by properties that provide long-term housing and that are not transitory or primarily medical in nature provides valuable information on how financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities. The comment provides that properties that provide long-term housing with related services are reportable under Regulation C, while properties that provide medical care are not, consistent with the exclusion of hospitals in comment 2(f)-3. The comment also clarifies that such properties are reportable when they combine long-term housing and related services with a medical care component. The comment will facilitate compliance by expanding on earlier guidance provided by the Board.<footnote ref="126">60 FR 63393, 63395 (Dec. 11, 1995). Fed.

            Section 1003.2(f) is being adopted to implement, in part, the definition of “mortgage loan” in HMDA section 303(2). That term would be implemented through other terms in Regulation C as well, including the definitions of “closed-end mortgage loan” and “covered loan.” In combination with other relevant provisions in Regulation C, the Bureau believes that the proposed definition of “dwelling” is a reasonable interpretation of the definition in that provision. Section 1003.2(f) is also adopted pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 305(a) of HMDA. Pursuant to section 305(a) of HMDA, the Bureau believes that this proposed definition is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of HMDA. The definition will serve HMDA's purpose of providing information to help determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities by providing information about various types of housing that are financed by financial institutions. The definition will facilitate compliance with HMDA requirements by providing clarity regarding what transactions must be reported for purposes of Regulation C.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Regulation C requires institutions that meet the definition of financial institution to collect and report HMDA data. HMDA and current Regulation C establish different coverage criteria for depository institutions (banks, savings associations, and credit unions) than for nondepository institutions (for-profit mortgage-lending institutions other than banks, savings associations, or credit unions).<footnote ref="127">HMDA sections 303(3) and 309(a); Regulation C § 1003.2 (definition of financial institution).</footnote>
            Under the current definition, depository institutions that originate one first-lien home purchase loan or refinancing secured by a one- to four-unit dwelling and that meet other criteria for “financial institution” must collect and report HMDA data, while certain nondepository institutions that originate many more mortgage loans annually do not have to collect and report HMDA data.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to adjust Regulation C's institutional coverage to adopt a uniform loan-volume threshold of 25 loans applicable to all financial institutions. Under the proposal, depository institutions and nondepository institutions that meet all of the other criteria for a “financial institution” would be required to report HMDA data if they originated at least 25 covered loans, excluding open-end lines of credit, in the preceding calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing changes to Regulation C's institutional coverage and adopting uniform loan-volume thresholds for depository and nondepository institutions. The loan-volume thresholds require an institution that originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans or at least 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years to report HMDA data, provided that the institution meets all of the other criteria for institutional coverage.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The final rule's changes to institutional coverage will provide several important benefits. First, the coverage test will improve the availability of data concerning the practices of nondepository institutions. The expanded coverage of nondepository institutions will ensure more equal visibility into the practices of nondepository institutions and depository institutions. With expanded HMDA data about nondepository lending, the public and public officials will be better able to protect consumers because historically, some riskier lending practices, such as those that led to the financial crisis, have emerged from the nondepository market sector.<footnote ref="128">See the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g)(ii) below for complete discussion.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Second, a significant number of lower-volume depository institutions will no longer be required to report HMDA data under the revised coverage test, which will eliminate those institutions' compliance costs. At the same time, the coverage test will preserve sufficient data for analyzing mortgage lending at the national, local, and institutional levels.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Third, the coverage test, by considering both an institution's closed-end and open-end origination volumes, will support the goal of increasing visibility into open-end dwelling-secured lending. This change to institutional coverage, along with the change to transactional coverage discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), will improve the public and public officials' ability to understand whether, and how, financial institutions are using open-end lines of credit to serve the housing needs of their communities. Incorporating open-end lending into the institutional coverage test will not require financial institutions that originate a small number of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit to report those loans. As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(11) and (12), the final rule also includes transactional thresholds. The transactional thresholds ensure that financial institutions that meet only the 25 closed-end mortgage loan threshold are not required to report their open-end lending, and that financial institutions that meet only the 100 open-end line of credit threshold are not required to report their closed-end lending.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, by considering two years of lending for coverage, the final rule will provide stability in reporting obligations for institutions. Accordingly, a financial institution that does not meet the loan-volume thresholds established in the final rule and that has an unexpected and unusually high loan-origination volume in one year will not be required to report HMDA data unless it maintains that level of lending for two consecutive years. The specific changes to the definition of financial institution applicable to nondepository institutions and depository institutions are discussed below separately.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed technical modifications to the commentary to the definition of financial institution. The Bureau received no comments on the proposed comments 2(g)-1 or -3 through -6, and is finalizing the commentary as proposed and with technical modifications to conform to definition of financial institution included in the final rule. The Bureau is also renumbering proposed comments 2(g)-3 through -6 as comments 2(g)-4 through -7. The Bureau is also adopting new comment 2(g)-3 to address how to determine whether an institution satisfies the definition of financial institution after a merger or acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>For ease of publication, the Bureau is reserving comment 2(g)-2, which sets forth the asset-size adjustment for depository financial institutions for each calendar year. The Bureau updates comment 2(g)-2 annually to make the adjustments to the level of the asset-size exemption for depository financial institutions required by HMDA section 309(b). The reserved comment will be replaced when the asset-size adjustment for the 2018 calendar year is published.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1003.2(g)(1) modified the definition of financial institution by defining a new term, depository financial institution, and adding a loan-volume threshold to the coverage criteria for depository institutions.

                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(g)(1), which defines depository financial institution, to include banks, savings associations, and credit unions, that meet the current criteria to be considered a financial institution,<footnote ref="132">Under § 1003.2, a bank, savings association, or credit union meets the definition of financial institution if it satisfies all of the following criteria: (1) On the preceding December 31, it had assets in excess of the asset threshold established and published annually by the Bureau for coverage by the Act; (2) on the preceding December 31, it had a home or branch office in a MSA; (3) during the previous calendar year, it originated at least one home purchase loan or refinancing of a home purchase loan secured by a first-lien on a one- to four-unit dwelling; and (4) the institution is federally insured or regulated, or the mortgage loan referred to in item (3) was insured, guaranteed, or supplemented by a Federal agency or intended for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.</footnote>

In addition, the final rule also requires lenders that meet the other criteria and that originate at least 100 open-end lines of credit to report HMDA data, even if those institutions did not originate at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans.

                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received many comments on proposed § 1003.2(g)(1). Industry commenters generally supported adopting a loan-volume threshold that would eliminate reporting by low-volume depository institutions,<footnote ref="133">Participants in the Board's 2010 Hearings also urged the Board to eliminate reporting by lower-volume depository institutions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Atlanta Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 40, (remarks of Phil Greer, Senior Vice President of Loan Administration, State Employees Credit Union) (noting that the burden of reporting only one loan would be low, but that the data reported would not provide &amp;#8220;meaningful information&amp;#8221;).</footnote>
            but urged the Bureau to adopt a much higher loan-volume threshold that would exempt more depository institutions from reporting. Industry commenters stated that low-volume depository institutions lack resources and sophistication and that their data have limited value. Industry commenters argued that a higher loan-volume threshold would not impact the availability of data for analysis at the national level or the ability to analyze lending at an institutional level. The commenters also advocated a consistent approach between the loan-volume threshold in Regulation C and the small creditor and small servicer definitions in the Bureau's title XIV Rules.<footnote ref="134">12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) (describing small creditor thresholds); 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4) (defining small servicer).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, several community advocate commenters expressed strong opposition to decreasing Regulation C's coverage of depository institutions. Most noted that the depository institutions that would be excluded are currently reporting, and therefore are accustomed to reporting. Many also highlighted the importance of the data reported by the depository institutions that would be excluded at the community level, especially in rural and underserved areas or to low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals and minorities. Commenters provided examples of reports and programs that rely on HMDA data at the census tract level.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Other community advocate commenters expressed support for the proposed loan-volume threshold, but noted concerns about the loss of data that may result if the Bureau adopted a loan-volume threshold greater than 25 loans. They highlighted concerns about the loss of data on particular types of transactions, such as applications submitted by African Americans, loans related to multifamily properties, and loans related to manufactured housing.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria should balance the burden on financial institutions with the value of the data reported. Depository institutions that are currently reporting should not bear the burden of reporting under Regulation C if their data are of limited value in the HMDA data set. At the same time, Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria should not impair HMDA's ability to achieve its purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Higher closed-end mortgage loan-volume thresholds, as suggested by industry, might not significantly impact the value of HMDA data for analysis at the national level. For example, it is possible to maintain reporting of a significant percentage of the national mortgage market with a closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold higher than 25 loans annually. In addition, it may also be true that data reported by some institutions that satisfy the proposed 25-loan-volume threshold may not be as useful for statistical analysis as data reported by institutions with much higher loan volumes.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>However, the higher closed-end mortgage loan-volume thresholds suggested by industry commenters would have a material negative impact on the availability of data about patterns and trends at the local level. Data about local communities is essential to achieve HMDA's three purposes, which are to provide the public and public officials with sufficient information: (1) To determine whether institutions are meeting their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities in which they are located; (2) to identify communities in need of targeted public and private investment; and (3) to assist in identifying discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.<footnote ref="135">Section 1003.1(b).</footnote>
            Public officials, community advocates, and researchers rely on HMDA data to analyze access to credit at the neighborhood level and to target programs to assist underserved communities and consumers.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Local and State officials have used HMDA data to identify and target relief to localities impacted by high-cost lending or discrimination. For example, policy makers in Lowell, Massachusetts identified a need for homebuyer counseling and education in Lowell, based on HMDA data, which showed a high percentage of high-cost loans compared to surrounding communities.<footnote ref="136">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; City of Lawrence, Massachusetts, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;HUD Consolidated Plan 2010-2015,&lt;/em&gt; at 68 (2010), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.cityoflawrence.com/Data/Sites/1/documents/cd/Lawrence_Consolidated_Plan_Final.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            Similarly, in 2008 the City of Albuquerque used HMDA data to characterize neighborhoods as “stable,” “prone to gentrification,” or “prone to disinvestment” for purposes of determining the most effective use of housing grants.<footnote ref="137">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; City of Albuquerque, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Five Year Consolidated Plan and Workforce Housing Plan,&lt;/em&gt; at 100 (2008), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.cabq.gov/family/documents/ConsolidatedWorkforceHousingPlan20082012final.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>

            Researchers and consumer advocates also analyze HMDA data at the census tract level to identify patterns of discrimination at the national level.<footnote ref="141">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; California Reinvestment Coalition, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et al, Paying More for the American Dream VI: Racial Disparities in FHA/VA Lending&lt;/em&gt; (2012), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.woodstockinst.org/sites/default/files/attachments/payingmoreVI_multistate_july2012_0.pdf&lt;/em&gt; ; Samantha Friedman &amp;amp; Gregory D.

                    <analysisParagraph>Any loan-volume threshold will affect individual markets differently, depending on the extent to which individual markets are served by smaller creditors and the market share of those creditors. The Bureau believes that a 25-closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold would impact the robustness of the data that would remain available only in a relatively small number of markets. For example, only about 45 census tracts would lose over 20 percent of currently reported data if a 25 closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold is used to trigger reporting.<footnote ref="142">As discussed in part VII below, the Bureau derived these estimates using 2013 HMDA data.</footnote>
            In contrast, the higher closed-end mortgage loan-volume thresholds requested by industry commenters would have a negative impact on data about more communities and consumers. For example, at a closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold set at 100, the number of census tracts that would lose 20 percent of reported data would increase from about 45 tracts to about 385 tracts, almost eight times more than the number with a threshold set at 25 closed-end mortgage loans.<footnote ref="143">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            The number of affected lower-middle income tracts would increase from about 20 tracts to about 145 tracts, an increase of over six times over the number at the 25-loan level.<footnote ref="144">As discussed in part VII below, the Bureau prepared these estimates using 2013 HMDA data and 2012 Community Reinvestment Act data.</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that the loss of data in communities at closed-end mortgage loan-volume thresholds higher than 25 would substantially impede the public's and public officials' ability to understand access to credit in their communities.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau does not believe that it should set the closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold at the levels in the small creditor and small servicer definitions in the Bureau's title XIV rules.<footnote ref="145">12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) (describing small creditor thresholds); 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4) (defining small servicer).</footnote>
            While the Bureau's title XIV rules and Regulation C may apply to some of the same institutions and transactions, Regulation C and the Bureau's title XIV rules have different objectives. HMDA aims to provide specific data to the public and public officials. For example, HMDA aims to provide sufficient information to the public and public officials to identify whether the housing needs of their communities are being served by the existing financial institutions. In contrast, the title XIV rule thresholds are designed to balance consumer protection and compliance burden in the context of very specific lending practices. As discussed above, an institutional coverage threshold at the levels of the small creditor and small servicer thresholds, which include thresholds of 2,000 and 5,000 loans, respectively,<footnote ref="146">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau recently increased the small creditor threshold to 2,000 applicable loans annually. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 80 FR 59943 (Oct. 2, 2015).</footnote>
            would undermine both the utility of HMDA data for analysis at the local level and the benefits that HMDA provides to communities.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement to report by institutions that originated fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans annually would meaningfully reduce burden. As discussed in part VII below, the proposed loan-volume threshold would relieve about 22 percent of depository institutions that are currently reporting of the obligation to report HMDA data on closed-end mortgage loans.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting a loan-volume threshold for depository institutions that will require reporting by depository institutions that originate at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans annually and meet the other applicable criteria in § 1003.2(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau, as discussed below in part VI, believes that the 25 closed-end loan-volume threshold for depository institutions should go into effect on January 1, 2017, one year earlier than the effective date for most of the remaining rule. To effectuate this earlier effective date, the Bureau is amending the definition of “financial institution” in § 1003.2.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>Loan-Volume Threshold for Open-End Lines of Credit</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>The loan-volume threshold provided in proposed § 1003.2(g)(1)(v) excluded open-end lines of credit from the loans that would count toward the threshold.<footnote ref="147">Under the proposed loan-volume threshold, the definition of open-end line of credit did not include open-end reverse mortgages. As a result, neither open-end nor closed-end reverse mortgages were excluded from the proposed loan-volume threshold. The definitions of closed-end mortgage loan and open-end line of credit included in the final rule include closed-end and open-end reverse mortgages, respectively, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d) and (o).</footnote>

            The Bureau solicited feedback on what types of loans should count toward the proposed loan-volume threshold and, in particular, whether open-end lines of credit should count toward the proposed loan-volume threshold. The final rule incorporates an institution's origination of open-end lines of credit into HMDA's institutional coverage criteria. Under the final rule, a financial institution will be required to report HMDA data on open-end lines of credit if it meets the other applicable criteria and originated at least 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years.<footnote ref="148">Under the final rule, all open-end transactions, whether traditional, reverse, or a combination of the two, count toward the open-end loan-volume threshold.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Relatively few commenters provided feedback on this issue. Some industry commenters stated that they supported the proposed exclusion of open-end lines of credit from the loans that count toward the loan-volume threshold. These commenters also suggested excluding other types of loans from the loans that count toward the threshold, including commercial loans, home-equity loans, and reverse mortgages. On the other hand, some industry commenters and a community advocate commenter stated that open-end lines of credit should count toward the loan-volume threshold. They explained that this would prevent institutions from steering consumers to open-end lines of credit to avoid being required to report HMDA data.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not finalizing the proposed exclusion of open-end lines of credit from Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria for the reasons discussed below. As noted above, the Bureau believes that Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria should balance the burden on financial institutions with the value of the data reported. Depository institutions that are currently reporting should not bear the burden of reporting under Regulation C if their data are of limited value in the HMDA data set. At the same time, Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria should support HMDA's purposes. The Bureau has determined that the exclusion of open-end lines of credit from Regulation C's institutional coverage criteria would not appropriately balance those considerations.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), the Bureau is finalizing the proposed expansion of the transactions reported in HMDA to include dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit, unless an exclusion applies.<footnote ref="149">Under the final rule, dwelling-secured, commercial-purpose open-end lines of credit will be covered loans only if they are for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(10).</footnote>
            Data about such transactions are not currently publicly available and, as discussed in the section-by-analysis of § 1003.2(o), the Bureau believes that having data about them will improve the understanding of how financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities and assist in the distribution of public sector investments. Like closed-end home-equity loans and refinancings, both of which are subject to broad coverage under the final rule, dwelling-secured credit lines may be used for home purchase, home improvement, and other purposes. Regardless of how they are used, they liquefy equity that borrowers have built up in their homes, which often are their most important assets. Borrowers who take out dwelling-secured credit lines increase their risk of losing their homes to foreclosure when property values decline, and in fact, the expansion of open-end line of credit originations in the mid-2000s contributed to the foreclosure crises that many communities experienced in the late 2000s.<footnote ref="150">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51757 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            Had open-end line of credit data been reported in HMDA, the public and public officials could have had a much earlier warning and a better understanding of potential risks, and public and private mortgage relief programs could have better assisted distressed borrowers in the aftermath of the crisis. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), dwelling-secured open-end lending is again on the rise now that the mortgage market has begun to recover from the crisis. The Bureau believes that it is important to improve visibility into this key segment of the mortgage market for all of the reasons discussed here and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>By excluding open-end lines of credit from the loan-volume threshold, the proposed coverage test would not support that goal. Under the proposed institutional coverage test, institutions that originate large numbers of open-end lines of credit, but fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans, would not be required to report HMDA data on any of their loans. The proposed test may, therefore, exclude institutions with significant open-end lending, whose data may provide valuable insights into the open-end dwelling-secured market. The proposed test may also create an incentive for institutions to change their business practices to avoid reporting open-end data (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> by transferring all open-end lending to a separate subsidiary). This result would undermine the goals articulated in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o) to increase visibility into open-end dwelling-secured lending.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In addition to possibly excluding high volume open-end lenders, the proposed test may also burden some institutions with low open-end origination volumes with the requirement to report data concerning their open-end lending. The proposed institutional coverage test would require institutions with sufficient closed-end—but very little open-end—mortgage lending to incur costs to begin open-end reporting. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o) below, commencing reporting of open-end lines of credit, unlike continuing to report closed-end mortgage loans, represents a new, and in some cases significant, compliance burden. The proposal would have imposed these costs on small institutions with limited open-end lending, where the benefits of reporting the data do not justify the costs of reporting.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In light of these considerations and those discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), the Bureau concludes that only institutions that originate at least 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years should report HMDA data concerning open-end lines of credit. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a separate, open-end loan-volume threshold to determine whether an institution satisfies the definition of financial institution. The Bureau is also adopting transactional coverage thresholds, discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(11) and (12). The institutional and transactional coverage thresholds are designed to operate in tandem. Under these thresholds, a financial institution will report closed-end mortgage loans only if it satisfies the closed-end mortgage threshold and will report open-end lines of credit only if it satisfies the separate open-end line credit threshold.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that adopting a 100-open-end line of credit threshold will avoid imposing the burden of establishing open-end reporting on many small institutions with low open-end lending volumes. Specifically, the Bureau estimates that almost 3,400 predominately smaller-sized institutions, that would have been required to begin open-end reporting under the proposal will not be required to report open-end data under the final rule.<footnote ref="151">As the Bureau discussed in the proposal, due to the lack of available data concerning open-end lending, the Bureau has faced challenges in analyzing the impact on HMDA's institutional and transactional coverage of including open-end lines of credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51754 (Aug. 29, 2014). Although it solicited information that would assist it in making these estimates, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see id.,&lt;/em&gt; commenters did not provide responsive data. After careful analysis, the Bureau has developed rough estimates of home-equity line of credit origination volumes by institutions using 2013 HMDA data, 2013 Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) data, and the Bureau's Consumer Credit Panel data. Given the scarcity of certain underlying data, these estimates rely on a number of assumptions. Nonetheless, for the reasons given above, including supporting increased visibility into the open-end line of credit market and reducing compliance burden for many institutions, the Bureau believes HMDA's purposes are best effectuated by adopting an open-end line of credit threshold. Part VII below discusses these estimates in more detail.</footnote>
            At the same time, the final rule will improve the availability of data concerning open-end dwelling-secured lending by collecting data from a sufficient array of institutions and about a sufficient array of transactions. The Bureau estimates that nearly 90 percent of all open-end line of credit originations will be reported under the final rule.<footnote ref="152">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; part VII.</footnote>
            This change to institutional coverage, along with the finalization of mandatory reporting of all consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit, will improve the public and public officials' ability to monitor and understand all sources of dwelling-secured lending and the risks posed to consumers and communities by those loans.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>For those reasons, the Bureau is modifying Regulation C's definition of depository financial institution by adopting an open-end loan-volume threshold. Under the revised definition, an institution satisfies the definition of a depository financial institution if it meets the other applicable criteria and either originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>Two-Year Look-Back Period</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>The proposed loan-volume threshold provided in proposed § 1003.2(g)(1)(v) considered only a financial institution's lending activity during the previous calendar year. The Bureau solicited feedback on whether to structure the loan-volume threshold over a multiyear period to provide greater certainty about the reporting requirements. Many industry commenters, including small entity representatives, urged the Bureau to include a multiyear look-back period in the loan-volume threshold.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a two-year look-back period is advisable to eliminate uncertainty surrounding reporting responsibilities. Under the final rule, a financial institution that does not meet the loan-volume thresholds established in the final rule and that experiences an unusual and unexpected high origination-volume in one year will not be required to begin HMDA reporting unless and until the higher origination-volume continues for a second year in a row. A first-time HMDA reporter must undertake significant one-time costs that include operational changes, such as staff training, information technology changes, and document retention policies. Therefore, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to develop a two-year look-back period for HMDA reporting to provide more stability around reporting responsibilities. Regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act provide similar look-back periods to determine coverage.<footnote ref="153">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 345.12(u)(1).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing the loan-volume threshold included in § 1003.2(g)(1)(v) and (2)(ii) with modifications to include a two-year look-back period. Sections 1003.2(g)(1)(v) and (2)(ii) provide that, assuming the other criteria are satisfied, an institution qualifies as a depository financial institution or a nondepository financial institution if the institution meets the applicable loan-volume threshold in each of the two preceding calendar years.</analysisParagraph>

                    <analysisParagraph>Under Regulation C, loans related to multifamily dwellings (multifamily mortgage loans) do not factor into the coverage criteria applicable to depository institutions. A depository institution that does not originate at least one home purchase loan or refinancing of a home purchase loan, secured by a first lien on a one- to four-unit dwelling in the preceding calendar year is not required to report HMDA data.<footnote ref="154">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1003.2 (definition of financial institution). When HMDA was enacted, the term &amp;#8220;federally related mortgage loan&amp;#8221; was defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) to include a loan secured by real property secured by a first lien on a one- to four-family dwelling and that meets other federally related tests. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Public Law 93-533, section 3164, 88 Stat. 1724 (1974).</footnote>
            The Bureau did not propose to eliminate the current loan activity test included in the coverage criteria for depository institutions. The proposal also did not solicit feedback on this aspect of the current coverage criteria or on other aspects of depository institutions' current coverage criteria.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Many community advocate commenters nonetheless urged the Bureau to expand depository institution coverage to require reporting by depository institutions that originate multifamily mortgage loans, but do not originate first-lien one- to four-unit home purchase loans or refinancings, and that meet the other coverage criteria. They argued that the current formulation makes it more difficult to understand availability of credit for multifamily dwellings. No industry commenters addressed this issue.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting the commenters' suggestion at this time. The Bureau recognizes that this prong of HMDA's depository institution coverage test may exclude certain depository institutions and their loans from HMDA data. However, the Bureau estimates that this provision excludes a very small number of depository institutions and loans, fewer than 20 institutions and about 200 covered loans under the final rule.<footnote ref="155">The Bureau developed this estimate using 2013 Call Report data.</footnote>

Pursuant to section 305(a) of HMDA, for the reasons given above, the Bureau finds that this proposed exception is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of HMDA.

            HMDA section 309(a) also authorizes the Bureau to adopt an exemption for covered nondepository institutions that are comparable within their respective industries to banks, savings associations, and credit unions with $10 million or less in assets in the previous fiscal year.<footnote ref="157">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; HMDA section 309(a), 12 U.S.C. 2808(a).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Under the current definition of financial institution in § 1003.2, a nondepository institution is a financial institution if it meets three criteria. First, the institution satisfies the following loan-volume or amount test: In the preceding calendar year, the institution originated home purchase loans, including refinancings of home purchase loans, that equaled either at least 10 percent of its loan-origination volume, measured in dollars, or at least $25 million.<footnote ref="158">The Board adopted the 10 percent loan-volume test in 1989 to implement the 1989 FIRREA amendments, which extended HMDA's reporting requirements to institutions “engaged for profit in the business of mortgage lending.” &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 54 FR 51356, 51358-59 (Dec. 15, 1989). In 2002, the Board modified the test and added the $25 million loan-volume test to require reporting by additional nondepository institutions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 67 FR 7222, 7224 (Feb. 15, 2002).</footnote>
            Second, on the preceding December 31, the institution had a home or branch office in an MSA.<footnote ref="159">Under § 1003.2 (definition of branch office), a nondepository institution has a branch office in an MSA if it originated, received applications for, or purchased five or more covered loans in that MSA in the preceding calendar year.</footnote>
            Third, the institution meets one of the following two criteria: (a) On the preceding December 31, the institution had total assets of more than $10 million, counting the assets of any parent corporation; or (b) in the preceding calendar year, the institution originated at least 100 home purchase loans, including refinancings of home purchase loans.<footnote ref="160">In 1989, the $10 million asset test, derived from section 309, applied to both depository and nondepository institutions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 54 FR 51356, 51359 (Dec. 15, 1989). Because the 1989 amendments failed to cover as many nondepository institutions as Congress had intended, in 1991, Congress amended the asset test in HMDA section 309 to apply only to depository institutions, and it granted the Board discretion to exempt comparable nondepository institutions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Public Law 102-242, section 224 (1991).

For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(g)(2), which revises the coverage criteria applicable to nondepository institutions.

                    <analysisParagraph>Most of the industry comments on this issue opposed the proposed expansion of nondepository institution coverage. These commenters explained that the proposed expansion would add only a small amount of additional data. Commenters also raised concerns about the burden on the nondepository institutions that would be newly covered. Some commenters suggested excluding more nondepository institutions from HMDA's institutional coverage, rather than expanding coverage of nondepository institutions, by adopting a loan-volume threshold higher than 100 closed-end mortgage loans annually, such as one set at origination of 250 closed-end mortgage loans annually. On the other hand, several consumer advocate commenters and a few industry commenters expressed support for the proposed expansion of nondepository institution coverage, arguing that nondepository institutions, like depository institutions, should be held accountable for their lending practices.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes, as stated in the proposal, that it is important to increase visibility into nondepository institutions' practices due to their history of riskier lending practices, including their role in the financial crisis, and the lack of available data about lower-volume nondepository institutions' mortgage lending practices. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(g)(2), which requires reporting if the institution meets the location test and originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years or 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. The Bureau estimates that the final rule will require HMDA reporting by as much as 40 percent more nondepository institutions than are currently reporting.<footnote ref="161">As discussed in part VII below, the Bureau developed this estimate using 2012 HMDA data and NMSLR data.</footnote>

                    <analysisParagraph>The expansion of nondepository institution reporting will address the longstanding need for additional monitoring of the mortgage lending practices of nondepository institutions. During the years leading up to the financial crisis, many stakeholders called for increased monitoring of nondepository institution activity in the mortgage market. Concerns about nondepository institution involvement in the subprime market motivated the Board to expand nondepository institution coverage in 2002.<footnote ref="162">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 65 FR 78656, 78657 (Dec. 15, 2000) (proposing changes to coverage of nondepository institutions); 67 FR 7222, 7224-25 (Feb. 15, 2002) (finalizing changes to coverage of nondepository institutions).</footnote>
            In 2007, the GAO also identified risks associated with the lending practices of nondepository institutions, which were not subject to regular Federal examination at the time.<footnote ref="163">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-08-78R, Briefing to the House of Representatives Committee on Fin.

            GAO found that 21 of the 25 largest originators of subprime and Alt-A loans in 2006 were nondepository institutions and that those 21 nondepository institutions had originated over 80 percent in dollar volume of the subprime and Alt-A loans originated in 2006.<footnote ref="164">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>

            In 2009, GAO found that nondepository institutions that reported HMDA data had a higher incidence of potential fair lending problems than depository institutions that reported HMDA data.<footnote ref="166">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-09-704, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Fair Lending: Data Limitations and the Fragmented U.S. Financial Regulatory Structure Challenge Federal Oversight and Enforcement Efforts&lt;/em&gt; at 28-29 (2009) (&amp;#8220;[I]ndependent lenders and nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies are more likely than depository institutions to engage in mortgage pricing discrimination.&amp;#8221;), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at  http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09704.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>

                    <analysisParagraph>In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Congress also expressed concerns about the lending practices of nondepository institutions generally and called for greater oversight of those institutions.<footnote ref="168">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; House Consideration of HR 4173, 155 Cong.

            In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress granted Federal supervisory authority to the Bureau over a broad range of mortgage-related nondepository institutions because it was concerned about nondepository institutions' practices generally and believed that the lack of Federal supervision of those institutions had contributed to the financial crisis.<footnote ref="169">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Dodd-Frank Act section 1024.</footnote>
            In addition, officials that participated in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearings in 2010 noted that practices that originated in the nondepository institution mortgage sector, such as lax underwriting standards and loan products with potential payment shock, created competitive pressures on depository institutions to follow the same practices, which may have contributed to the broader financial crisis.<footnote ref="170">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Official Transcript of First Public Hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission at 97-98 (Jan. 10, 2010), (remarks of Sheila C.

            During the Board's 2010 Hearings, community advocates and Federal agencies specifically urged expansion of HMDA's institutional coverage to include lower-volume nondepository institutions. They stated that Regulation C's existing institutional coverage framework prevented them from effectively monitoring the practices of nondepository institutions.<footnote ref="171">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; San Francisco Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 42; Washington Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 39 (remarks of Faith Schwartz, Senior Advisor, HOPE NOW Alliance) (urging reporting by all institutions that have &amp;#8220;any meaningful originations&amp;#8221;); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt; (remarks of Allison Brown, Acting Assistant Director, Division of Financial Practices, Federal Trade Commission) (urging expanded reporting by nondepository institutions &amp;#8220;to ensure that all nondepository institutions that made significant numbers of mortgage decisions report these essential data, providing the government and the public an accurate, timely picture of mortgage lending activity&amp;#8221;); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt; (remarks of Michael Bylsma, Director for Community and Consumer Law, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) (urging the Board to &amp;#8220;review whether its rule-making authority&amp;#8221; would permit it to expand HMDA coverage to additional institutions); Atlanta Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 40.</footnote>

                    <analysisParagraph>Despite these calls for increased monitoring of nondepository institutions, currently there are less publicly available data about nondepository institutions' mortgage lending practices than about those of depository institutions. Currently, under Regulation C, lower-volume depository institutions may be required to report even if they originated only one mortgage loan in the preceding calendar year, but lower-volume nondepository institutions may not be required to report unless they originated 100 applicable loans in the preceding calendar year.<footnote ref="172">Banks, savings associations, and credit unions are required to report if they originate at least one home purchase or refinancing of a home purchase loan secured by a first lien on a one- to four-family dwelling and if they meet the other criteria in the definition of financial institution. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Section 1003.2 (definition of financial institution).</footnote>
            In addition, outside of HMDA, there are less publicly available data about nondepository institutions than about depository institutions. Depository institutions, even those that do not report HMDA data, report detailed financial information at the bank level to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or to the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), much of which is publicly available.<footnote ref="173">Every national bank, State member bank, and insured nonmember bank is required by its primary Federal regulator to file consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, also known as Call Report data, for each quarter as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar quarter (the report date). The specific reporting requirements depend upon the size of the bank and whether it has any foreign offices. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; FDIC, Call and Thrift Financial Reports, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www2.fdic.gov/call_tfr_rpts/&lt;/em&gt;.

            Nondepository institutions, on the other hand, report some data to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR), but detailed financial information and data on mortgage applications and originations are not publicly available.<footnote ref="174">NMLSR is a national registry of nondepository institutions. Nondepository institutions report information about mortgage loan originators, mortgage loan originations, the number and dollar amount of loans brokered, and HOEPA originations.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The final rule addresses this information gap by including the same loan-volume threshold for nondepository institutions as for depository institutions. The expanded coverage of nondepository institutions will provide more data to the public and public officials for analyzing whether lower-volume nondepository institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities. In addition, with the expanded coverage, the public and public officials will be better able to understand access to and sources of credit in particular communities, such as a higher concentration of risky loan products in a given community, and to identify the emergence of new loan products or underwriting practices. In addition, the final rule will provide more data to help the public and public officials in understanding whether a lower-volume nondepository institution's practices pose potential fair lending risks.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The final rule also considers origination of open-end lines of credit in the institutional coverage test for nondepository institutions. The Bureau believes that this revision is necessary to achieve greater visibility into all extensions of credit secured by a dwelling, as discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g)(1). In addition, for the reasons discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g)(1), the final rule also incorporates a two-year look-back period for nondepository institution coverage.</analysisParagraph>

                    <analysisParagraph>The current coverage criteria for nondepository institutions include an asset-size or loan-volume threshold.<footnote ref="175">Section 1003.2 (financial institution) (2).</footnote>
            This test is satisfied both by institutions that meet a certain asset-size threshold and by those with smaller asset sizes that have a higher loan-volume.<footnote ref="176">Section 1003.2 (financial institution) (2)(B)(iii).</footnote>

            The Bureau proposed to eliminate the asset-size or loan-volume threshold for nondepository institutions currently included in Regulation C because, for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau believes it is important to increase visibility into the practices of nondepository institutions. A few industry commenters objected to the proposal's elimination of the asset-size portion of the asset-size or loan-volume threshold for nondepository institutions. The Bureau believes that the current asset-size or loan-volume threshold is no longer necessary, because the Bureau is adopting the 25 closed-end mortgage loan-volume threshold and 100 open-end line of credit threshold discussed in this section. Under the final rule, nondepository institutions will be required to report if they originated 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. An institution's asset-size will no longer trigger reporting (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> nondepository institutions with assets greater than $10 million that originated fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans or fewer than 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years will not be required to report HMDA data). In addition, at this time and in light of the coverage criteria being finalized, the Bureau does not believe the asset-size exemption is necessary. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exercise its discretion under HMDA section 309(a) to eliminate the exemption of certain nondepository institutions based on their asset-size.<footnote ref="177">The Bureau consulted with HUD as part of the interagency consultation process for this rulemaking.</footnote>

                    <analysisParagraph>No commenters discussed the proposed new implementation of HMDA sections 303(3)(B) and 303(5), which require persons other than banks, savings associations, and credit unions that are “engaged for profit in the business of mortgage lending” to report HMDA data. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the Bureau interprets these provisions, as the Board also did, to evince the intent to exclude from coverage institutions that make a relatively small volume of mortgage loans.<footnote ref="178">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 54 FR 51356, 51358-59 (Dec. 15, 1989).</footnote>
            In light of more recent activities of nondepository institutions discussed above, the Bureau believes that Regulation C's current coverage test for nondepository institutions inappropriately excludes certain persons that are engaged for profit in the business of mortgage lending. The Bureau estimates that financial institutions that reported 25 loans in HMDA for the 2012 calendar year originated an average of approximately $5,359,000 in covered loans annually. Given this level of mortgage activity, and consistent with the policy reasons discussed above, the Bureau interprets “engaged for profit in the business of mortgage lending” to include nondepository institutions that originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Due to the questions raised about potential risks posed to applicants and borrowers by nondepository institutions and the lack of other publicly available data sources about nondepository institutions, the Bureau believes that requiring additional nondepository institutions to report HMDA data will better effectuate HMDA's purposes.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(h) Home-Equity Line of Credit</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regulation C currently defines “home-equity line of credit” as an open-end credit plan secured by a dwelling as defined in Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), 12 CFR part 1026. The Bureau did not propose to change this definition. Existing § 1003.4(c)(3), in turn, provides that financial institutions optionally may report home-equity lines of credit made in whole or in part for home improvement or home purchase purposes. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(e) and (o), the Bureau proposed to expand Regulation C's transactional coverage to require reporting of all home-equity lines of credit.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As part of the shift to dwelling-secured coverage, the Bureau proposed a separate definition for “open-end lines of credit” in § 1003.2(o), to reflect the proposed coverage of both consumer- and commercial-purpose lines of credit. As proposed, § 1003.2(o) generally defined an open-end line of credit as a dwelling-secured transaction that was an open-end credit plan under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20), but without regard to whether the transaction: (1) Was for personal, family, or household purposes; (2) was extended by a creditor; or (3) was extended to a consumer. In other words, the proposal defined “open-end line of credit” broadly to include any dwelling-secured open-end credit transaction, whether for consumer or commercial purposes, and regardless of who was extending or receiving the credit. In general, then, the proposed definition of open-end line of credit included all transactions covered by the existing definition of home-equity line of credit in § 1003.2. For the reasons discussed below, the final rule removes the term “home-equity line of credit” from the regulation, reserves § 1003.2(h), and retains the term “open-end line of credit.”</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), the Bureau received a large number of comments about its proposal to require reporting of all dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit, and those comments are addressed in that section. One commenter specifically addressed the Bureau's proposal to define both “home-equity line of credit” and “open-end line of credit.” The commenter supported adding a definition for “open-end line of credit” but believed that distinguishing between open-end lines of credit and home-equity lines of credit was confusing. The commenter suggested that the Bureau streamline the types of covered transactions into dwelling-secured closed-end mortgage loans, dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit, and reverse mortgages (whether closed- or open-end).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(o), the final rule adopts the proposed definition of open-end line of credit largely as proposed. For simplicity, the final rule removes the defined term “home-equity line of credit” and retains the defined term “open-end line of credit” to refer to all open-end credit transactions covered by the regulation.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires financial institutions to report whether a transaction is an open-end line of credit (§ 1003.4(a)(37)), a commercial- or business-purpose transaction (§ 1003.4(a)(38)), or a reverse mortgage (§ 1003.4(a)(36)). Using this information, it will be possible to determine whether a given open-end line of credit primarily is for consumer purposes (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a home-equity line of credit) or primarily is for commercial or business purposes, and also whether it is a reverse mortgage. The Bureau thus believes that it is unnecessary to retain the defined term “home-equity line of credit.”</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1003.2(i) provided that a home improvement loan was any covered loan made for the purpose, in whole or in part, of repairing, rehabilitating, remodeling, or improving a dwelling, or the real property on which the dwelling is located. Pursuant to the Bureau's authority under HMDA section 305(a), the proposal revised § 1003.2(i) and its accompanying commentary to conform to the proposal to remove non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans from coverage, and to clarify when to report dwelling-secured home improvement loans. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(i) largely as proposed, with certain technical revisions to the regulation text,<footnote ref="179">For example, the final rule replaces the term “covered loan” in § 1003.2(i) with the terms “closed-end mortgage loan” and “open-end line of credit.” This change reflects the fact that, under final §§ 1003.2(e) and 1003.3(c)(10), business- or commercial-purpose transactions are covered loans only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. Retaining the term “covered loan” in the definition of home improvement loan would cause circularity in the definition of commercial-purpose transactions.</footnote>
            and with revisions to the commentary to streamline it and to add examples or details requested by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received numerous comments from consumer advocacy groups, financial institutions, trade associations, and other industry participants concerning proposed § 1003.2(i).

A few commenters requested that the Bureau clarify certain aspects of the commentary to the home improvement loan definition.</analysisParagraph>

                    <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy groups uniformly stated that the Bureau should maintain reporting of home improvement lending, because such lending has been particularly important to low- and moderate-income borrowers and borrowers of color as a way to finance home repairs. Most of these commenters did not specifically distinguish between dwelling-secured and non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending or specify how they use non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending data, in particular, to achieve HMDA's purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>One financial institution urged the Bureau to retain reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending, at least on an optional basis. This commenter stated that non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending can be critical in revitalizing low-to-moderate income communities, including in rural areas, and for financing manufactured home improvements. The commenter expressed concern that financial institutions might stop offering non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans if they were no longer HMDA-reportable. The commenter believed that borrowers would be steered toward home-equity lines of credit, which might be unavailable to low- and moderate-income borrowers with inadequate home equity. The commenter argued that optional reporting would relieve burden for institutions that choose not to report, while allowing institutions that do report to receive credit for serving the housing needs of their communities.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>All other industry commenters that addressed proposed § 1003.2(i) supported excluding non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans from coverage.<footnote ref="180">Various commenters recommended eliminating the home improvement purpose category for all loans. Those comments are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.4(a)(3).</footnote>
            Many of these commenters stated that reporting such loans is burdensome and costly because it is difficult to determine whether the loan will be used for a housing-related purpose, because reporting errors occur frequently, and because examiners have not treated non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending consistently. Other commenters noted that the value of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loan data is limited. Interest rates and terms can vary dramatically depending on the loan and non-dwelling collateral used, and consumers now often use home-equity lines of credit. One commenter stated that the burdens of reporting can outweigh the benefits of making the loans, because non-dwelling-secured home improvement loan amounts tend to be small.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(i) as proposed, without a requirement to report non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans. At this time, the Bureau does not believe that the benefits of requiring reporting of such loans justify the burdens. For example, many consumer advocacy group commenters urged the Bureau to retain reporting of all home improvement loans because such loans are important to low-to-moderate income communities. These commenters, however, did not state that they or others have used HMDA data about non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans to further HMDA's purposes. Moreover, as discussed in the proposal, non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans may have been common when HMDA was enacted. However, such loans now comprise only a small fraction of transactions reported,<footnote ref="181">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51755 (Aug. 29, 2014) (noting that non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans comprised only approximately 1.8 percent of all HMDA records in 2012).</footnote>

                    <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, the burdens of reporting such transactions appear to be significant. As discussed in the proposal, these loans are processed, underwritten, and originated through different loan origination systems than are used for dwelling-secured lending.<footnote ref="183">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 51755 (Aug. 29, 2014) (citing Chicago Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 46 and Atlanta Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 40).</footnote>
            As noted above, many industry commenters confirmed and elaborated on the burdens of reporting non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans discussed in the Bureau's proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>On balance, the Bureau concluded that the compliance burden that will be eliminated by streamlining the regulation to require reporting only of dwelling-secured loans justifies the relatively small data loss that will accompany the change. The Bureau considered, as one commenter suggested, maintaining optional reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans. However, one of the proposal's goals was to simplify Regulation C's transactional coverage. Maintaining optional reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans would inhibit the Bureau's ability to reduce regulatory complexity by focusing on dwelling-secured lending for an apparently small benefit.<footnote ref="184">The Bureau acknowledges that removing non-dwelling-secured home improvement lending will affect some institutions' reported transaction volumes, which in turn will affect CRA reporting. The Bureau will work with other regulators during the Regulation C implementation period to address these issues.</footnote>

            Thus, the final rule requires financial institutions to report only dwelling-secured loans. Unsecured home improvement loans and home improvement loans secured by collateral other than a dwelling (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a vehicle or savings account), are not reportable.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>One commenter objected that the Bureau's proposal to eliminate reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans did not address the fact that the HMDA statute still requires reporting of home improvement loans. The Bureau believes, however, that requiring financial institutions to report dwelling-secured home improvement loans satisfies the statutory requirement. As the proposal noted, HMDA does not expressly define “home improvement loan.” Although non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans traditionally have been reported, the Bureau believes that it is reasonable to interpret HMDA section 303(2) to include only loans that are secured by liens on dwellings, as that interpretation aligns with common definitions of the term mortgage loan, and such loans will include home improvement loans.<footnote ref="185">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51755-56 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is eliminating reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans pursuant to its authority under section 305(a) of HMDA, as the Bureau believes that this adjustment and exception is necessary and proper to effectuate HMDA's purposes and to facilitate compliance. Specifically, the Bureau believes that non-dwelling-secured home improvement loan data may distort the overall quality of the HMDA dataset for the reasons described above. The Bureau believes that eliminating reporting of non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans will improve the quality of HMDA data, which will provide citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether financial institutions are meeting the housing needs of their communities and to assist public officials in determining how to distribute public sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private investment environment. The Bureau further believes that eliminating these loans will facilitate compliance by removing a significant reporting burden.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>Home Improvement Loan Definition</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>A few commenters asked the Bureau to clarify certain aspects of home improvement loan reporting as addressed in the commentary. The final rule adopts the commentary generally as proposed, but with several revisions and additions to address commenters' questions, as well as certain other modifications for clarity, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(i)-1, which provided general guidance about home improvement loans, is adopted as proposed, but with several non-substantive revisions for clarity and with an additional example of a transaction that meets the home improvement loan definition. Consistent with the final rule's requirement under § 1003.2(d) to report loans completed pursuant to a New York CEMA, final comment 2(i)-1 explains that, where all or a portion of the funds from a CEMA transaction will be used for home improvement purposes, the loan is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i). One commenter asked whether loans that are not “classified” by an institution as home improvement loans nonetheless should be reported as home improvement loans if the supporting documents show that they were for home improvement purposes. The classification test in existing Regulation C applies only to non-dwelling-secured home improvement loans. As discussed, the final rule eliminates such loans from coverage. Under the final rule, there no longer is any requirement that a loan be “classified” by a financial institution as a home improvement loan to be a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not propose to revise existing comment Home improvement loan-3. The final rule adopts this comment as comment 2(i)-3 with minor revisions to reflect the fact that the final rule requires reporting of both closed- and open-end transactions.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(i)-4 concerning mixed-use properties is adopted largely as proposed. The comment is revised for clarity and to eliminate the statement that a home improvement loan for a mixed-use property is reported as such only if the property itself is primarily residential in nature. Under § 1003.2(e) and (f), a transaction is a covered loan and subject to Regulation C only if it is secured by a dwelling, which by definition is property that is primarily residential in nature. Thus, financial institutions need not separately consider whether a dwelling primarily is residential in nature when determining whether a loan is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have removed existing comment Home improvement loan-5, which discusses how to report a home improvement loan that also is a home purchase loan or a refinancing, because the proposal consolidated all such reporting instructions in § 1003.4. The final rule retains existing comment Home improvement loan-5 and adopts it as comment 2(i)-5 to explain that a transaction with multiple purposes may meet multiple loan-type definitions. The comment provides an example to illustrate that a transaction that meets the definition of a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i) may also meet the definition of a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). Comment 2(i)-5 also specifies that instructions for reporting a multiple-purpose covered loan are in the commentary to § 1003.4(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>A few commenters asked the Bureau to clarify further how a financial institution determines whether a loan is a home improvement loan. For example, one commenter asked whether a cash-out refinance also is a home improvement loan if the borrower states that some of the cash may be used for home improvement. Another asked whether a loan is a home improvement loan when a consumer states that a loan is for home improvement purposes but it is in fact for purchasing a household item. This commenter also requested that “small-dollar” home improvement loans be exempt from reporting.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In response to these comments, the final rule includes comment 2(i)-6, which provides that a financial institution relies on the borrower's stated purpose for the loan when the application is received or the credit decision is made, and need not confirm that the borrower actually uses any of the funds for home improvement purposes. If the borrower does not state that any of the funds will be used for home improvement purposes, or does not state any purpose for the funds, the loan is not a home improvement loan. Section 1003.4(a)(3) and related commentary provide instructions about how to report such loans. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.4(a)(3). The final rule does not specifically exempt small-dollar home improvement loans, because the Bureau believes that information about such loans is valuable, but the final rule retains in § 1003.3(c)(7) the current exclusion from coverage for transactions for less than $500.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(j) Home Purchase Loan</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regulation C currently provides that a home purchase loan is a loan secured by and made for the purpose of purchasing a dwelling. Proposed § 1003.2(j) revised the definition to provide that a home purchase loan is a “covered loan” extended for the purpose of purchasing a dwelling. The proposal also revised the commentary to proposed § 1003.2(j) in several ways, primarily to conform the commentary to the proposal's overall shift to covering only dwelling-secured transactions. Only a handful of commenters addressed proposed § 1003.2(j) or its accompanying commentary, and none of them specifically commented on the proposed regulation text. The Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(j) largely as proposed, with technical revisions for clarity.<footnote ref="186">Specifically, the final rule replaces the term “covered loan” in § 1003.2(j) with the terms “closed-end mortgage loan” and “open-end line of credit.” This change reflects the fact that, under final §§ 1003.2(e) and 1003.3(c)(10), business- or commercial-purpose transactions are covered loans only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. Retaining the term “covered loan” in the definition of home purchase loan would cause circularity in the definition of commercial-purpose transactions.</footnote>
            The Bureau is finalizing the commentary to § 1003.2(j) with revisions to address questions that commenters raised regarding assumptions, to clarify how Regulation C applies to multiple-purpose transactions, and to remove certain comments as unnecessary.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>First, the Bureau is not adopting proposed comment 2(j)-1 in the final rule. Proposed comment 2(j)-1 provided general guidance about the definition of home purchase loan, including an illustrative example stating that a home purchase loan includes a closed-end mortgage loan but does not include a home purchase completed through an installment contract. No commenters addressed proposed comment 2(j)-1. The final rule incorporates the terms “closed-end mortgage loan” and “open-end credit plan” in § 1003.2(j). Thus, there is no need to restate in commentary that a closed-end mortgage loan used to purchase a dwelling is a home purchase loan. The Bureau is finalizing the illustrative example discussing installment contracts in commentary to § 1003.2(d), which provides guidance about the term closed-end mortgage loan. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The proposal renumbered as proposed comment 2(j)-2 existing comment Home purchase loan-1, which provides that a home purchase loan includes a loan secured by one dwelling and used to purchase another dwelling. Two industry commenters stated that “home purchase loan” should not include these loan types and recommended that they be defined instead as “home-equity loans.” The commenters stated that, under Regulation Z, a loan is not a home purchase loan (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a “residential mortgage transaction” under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(24)) unless its funds are used to purchase the property securing the dwelling. The commenters stated that industry stakeholders generally view loans secured by one dwelling but used to purchase a different dwelling as home-equity loans, not as purchase loans.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Revising § 1003.2(j) in the way that commenters suggested would better align Regulations C and Z. In general, regulatory consistency is desirable; however, HMDA's purposes are different from Regulation Z's purposes. To understand how financial institutions are meeting the housing needs of their communities, it is important to understand the total volume of loans made to purchase dwellings, even if those loans are secured by dwellings other than the ones being purchased. The suggested revision also would require adding a new defined term, home-equity loan, to Regulation C. This term necessarily would lump together loans secured by one dwelling, but used to purchase, improve, or refinance loans on other dwellings; reporting the loans in this way would obscure the valuable information described above. Thus, the Bureau is finalizing proposed comment 2(j)-2 largely as proposed, with certain non-substantive revisions for clarity, and renumbered as comment 2(j)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments addressing proposed comment 2(j)-3, which made only minor revisions to existing comment Home purchase loan-2 addressing whether a transaction to purchase a mixed-use property is a home purchase loan. However, the final rule eliminates this comment as unnecessary. As proposed, the comment stated that a transaction to purchase a mixed-use property is a home purchase loan if the property primarily is used for residential purposes, and it provided guidance about how to determine the primary use of the property. Under the final rule, a transaction is not covered by Regulation C unless it is secured by a dwelling, which is defined under § 1003.2(f) to include only mixed-use properties that primarily are used for residential purposes. Because financial institutions will have determined under § 1003.2(f) whether a mixed-used property is a dwelling, there is no need to reevaluate that decision when determining whether a transaction is a home purchase loan.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal's consolidation of excluded transactions into § 1003.3(c), the proposal moved existing comment Home purchase loan-3, which discusses agricultural-purpose loans, to proposed comment 3(c)(9)-1. No commenters addressed this reorganization, and the Bureau is finalizing proposed comment 3(c)(9)-1, with revisions, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(9).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The proposal did not propose to revise existing comments Home purchase loan-4, -5, or -6, and the Bureau received no comments addressing them. These comments are adopted in the final rule as comments 2(j)-2 through -4, respectively, with minor revisions for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.1(c) regarding Regulation C's scope, the proposal reorganized the commentary to § 1003.1(c). Consistent with that reorganization, the proposal incorporated a revised version of existing comment 1(c)-9, which discusses coverage of assumptions, as comment 2(j)-7 to the definition of home purchase loan. One industry commenter addressed this comment. The commenter argued that proposed comment 2(j)-7 should specify, consistent with Regulation Z, that a successor-in-interest transaction is not an assumption.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts proposed comment 2(j)-7 as comment 2(j)-5, with revisions to address the comment received, and with other clarifying revisions, as follows. First, comment 2(j)-5 states that an assumption is a home purchase loan only if the transaction is to finance the new borrower's acquisition of the property (and not, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> if the borrower has succeeded in interest to ownership).<footnote ref="187">However, as discussion in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d), the final rule provides that successor-in-interest transactions are assumptions for purposes of Regulation C.</footnote>
            Also, consistent with § 1003.2(d) and comment 2(d)-2.ii, which provide that transactions documented pursuant to New York consolidation, extension and modification agreements are extensions of credit, comment 2(j)-5 clarifies that a transaction in which borrower B finances the purchase of borrower A's dwelling by assuming borrower A's existing debt obligation is a home purchase loan even if the transaction is documented pursuant to a New York consolidation, extension, and modification agreement.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to remove existing comment Home purchase loan-7, which described how to report multiple-purpose home-purchase loans, because the proposal consolidated all such reporting instructions in § 1003.4. The final rule retains as comment 2(j)-6 a variation of existing comment Home purchase loan-7 to explain that a transaction with multiple purposes may meet multiple loan-type definitions. The comment provides an illustrative example and specifies that instructions for reporting a multiple-purpose loan are in the commentary to § 1003.4(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Two commenters requested additional guidance about the definition of home purchase loan. One commenter stated that additional guidance is necessary because there are several ways to transfer property ownership to third parties, not all of which are called a “purchase.” The commenter did not specify the other methods it was referencing. As discussed, comment 2(j)-5 provides guidance about two additional methods of title transfer. The Bureau can address additional scenarios in the future, if necessary. Another commenter requested guidance about whether a loan to one sibling to purchase half of another sibling's home, which the other sibling owns outright, is a reportable home purchase loan or a refinancing when the loan is secured by the portion of the home being purchased. Based on the details provided, such a transaction is reportable, because it is a dwelling-secured loan and is not excluded under § 1003.3(c). Because it is for the purpose of purchasing a dwelling, and it does not satisfy and replace an existing, dwelling-secured debt obligation, it is a home purchase loan but it is not a refinancing. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(p).</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>2(k) Loan/Application Register</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regulation C requires financial institutions to collect and record reportable data in a format prescribed by the regulation. The Bureau proposed to refer to this format as the “loan application register” to improve the readability of the regulation and proposed to define it as a register in the format prescribed in appendix A. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this proposed definition. As explained in part I.B above, in order to streamline the regulation, the final rule removes appendix A. Therefore, the Bureau is revising proposed § 1003.2(k) to remove references to appendix A and defining loan/application register to mean both the record of information required to be collected pursuant to § 1003.4 and the record submitted annually or quarterly, as applicable, pursuant to § 1003.5(a). In addition, the Bureau is adding “/” to maintain consistency with the term as currently used and to clarify that the data recorded represents applications as well as loan originations. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(k) with revisions.</analysisParagraph>

Other comments related to coverage and reporting of manufactured homes and similar residential structures are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(f) and § 1003.4(a)(5). The Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(l) generally as proposed, with minor revisions. The definition is revised to clarify that, for purposes of the construction method reporting requirement under § 1003.4(a)(5), a manufactured home community should be reported as manufactured home.

                  <title>2(o) Open-End Line of Credit</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>HMDA section 303(2) defines “mortgage loan” as a residential real property-secured loan or a home improvement loan but does not specifically address coverage of open-end lines of credit secured by dwellings. Regulation C also currently does not define the term “open-end line of credit.” However, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(h), Regulation C currently defines the term “home-equity line of credit” as an open-end credit plan secured by a dwelling as defined in Regulation Z. Under existing Regulation C § 1003.4(c)(3), financial institutions may, but are not required to, report home-equity lines of credit made in whole or in part for home purchase or home improvement purposes.<footnote ref="189">Under existing Regulation C § 1003.4(a)(7) and comment 4(a)(7)-3, if a financial institution opts to report home-equity lines of credit, it reports only the portion of the line intended for home improvement or home purchase.</footnote>
            Commercial-purpose lines of credit secured by a dwelling fall outside of Regulation Z's definition of open-end credit plan and thus are not optionally reported as home-equity lines of credit under existing Regulation C.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In 2000, in response to the increasing importance of open-end lending in the housing market, the Board proposed to revise Regulation C to require mandatory reporting of all home-equity lines of credit.<footnote ref="190">Home-equity lines of credit were rare in the 1970s and early 1980s when Regulation C was first implemented. Regulation C first addressed home-equity lines of credit in 1988, when it permitted financial institutions to report home-equity lines of credit that were home improvement loans. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 53 FR 31683, 31685 (Aug. 19, 1988).</footnote>
            The Board's proposal was based on research showing that about 70 percent of all home-equity lines of credit were being used at least in part for home improvement purposes. The Board believed that requiring reporting of all home-equity lines of credit would provide more complete information about the home improvement market, one of HMDA's original purposes.<footnote ref="191">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 65 FR 78656, 78659-60 (Dec. 15, 2000).</footnote>
            The Board's 2002 final rule concluded that, while collecting data on home-equity lines of credit would give a more complete picture of the home mortgage market, the benefits of mandatory reporting relative to other proposed changes (such as collecting information about higher-priced loans) did not justify the increased burden.<footnote ref="192">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 67 FR 7222, 7225 (Feb. 15, 2002).</footnote>
            The Board thus decided to retain optional reporting.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Open-end mortgage lending continued to increase in the years following the Board's 2002 final rule, and the Board continued to receive feedback urging such lending to be reported in HMDA.<footnote ref="193">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Donghoon Lee et al., Fed. Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report No. 569, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;A New Look at Second Liens,&lt;/em&gt; at 11 (Aug. 2012) (approximately $20 billion in home-equity lines of credit were originated in the fourth quarter of 1999; by the fourth quarter of 2005, approximately $125 billion in HELOCs were originated). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See generally, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Atlanta Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 40; San Francisco Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 42; Chicago Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 46; Washington Hearing, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 39.</footnote>
            The Bureau received similar feedback after it assumed rulemaking authority for HMDA from the Board in 2011.<footnote ref="194">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; National Community Reinvestment Coalition et al., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Creating Comprehensive HMDA and Loan Performance Databases: White Paper Submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/em&gt; at 15 (Feb. 15, 2013), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.empirejustice.org/assets/pdf/policy-advocacy/consumer-organizations-urge.pdf&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
            The feedback suggested that home-equity lines of credit have become increasingly important to the housing market and that requiring such lending to be reported under Regulation C would help to understand how financial institutions are meeting the housing needs of communities. The Bureau thus proposed to require financial institutions to report all home-equity lines of credit, as well as all commercial-purpose lines of credit secured by a dwelling.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau proposed new § 1003.2(o) to define the term “open-end line of credit,” which included any dwelling-secured open-end credit plan, as described under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20), even if the credit was issued by someone other than a creditor (as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(17)), to someone other than a consumer (as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(11)) and for business rather than consumer purposes (as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(12)). Together with proposed § 1003.2(e), which provided that all open-end lines of credit were “covered loans,” proposed § 1003.2(o) provided that financial institutions must report: (1) all consumer-purpose home-equity lines of credit, which currently are optionally reported, and (2) all dwelling-secured commercial-purpose lines of credit, which currently are not reported. In short, the proposal provided for reporting of all dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="195">79 FR 51731, 51757-59 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>

The Bureau understands that, notwithstanding the modifications described above, financial institutions may incur significant costs as a result of open-end line of credit reporting. However, the Bureau believes that the benefits of reporting justify the burdens.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a large number of comments about proposed § 1003.2(o). The vast majority of the comments discussed whether reporting of dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit should be mandatory and, if so, the scope of transactions that should be reported. A few commenters raised specific questions about the proposed definition of open-end line of credit. Consumer advocacy group commenters and researchers favored mandatory reporting, while the majority of industry commenters strongly opposed it. Among industry commenters that addressed mandatory reporting, most objected to reporting any open-end lines of credit. Some, however, specifically objected to mandatory reporting of commercial-purpose lines of credit. For organizational purposes, the Bureau addresses in this section-by-section analysis comments about: (1) Open-end line of credit coverage generally; (2) consumer-purpose line of credit coverage specifically; and (3) the definition of “open-end line of credit” in proposed § 1003.2(o).<footnote ref="196">Many commenters used the common phrase “home-equity lines of credit” or “HELOC” to discuss all open-end mortgage lending. For simplicity and to align with the final rule's deletion of the defined term “home-equity line of credit” from Regulation C (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.2(h)), the Bureau hereinafter refers to covered (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; dwelling-secured) open-end transactions simply as consumer- or commercial-purpose &amp;#8220;open-end lines of credit.&amp;#8221;</footnote>
            Comments specific to commercial-purpose lines of credit are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(10) concerning commercial-purpose transactions.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocacy group commenters and researchers favored mandatory reporting of all consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit. A large number of these commenters stated that data about open-end lines of credit would be valuable in assessing whether neighborhoods are receiving the full range of credit that they need on nondiscriminatory terms. The commenters stated that open-end lines of credit are much more widely used today than when HMDA was enacted, that problematic practices were associated with these products during the 2000s, that defaults on open-end credit lines contributed significantly to the foreclosure crises in many neighborhoods, and that open-end credit lines are important sources of home improvement financing, particularly in minority and immigrant communities. The commenters stated that fully understanding the mortgage market, including problems relating to overextension of credit in minority and immigrant neighborhoods, requires more detailed information about such transactions. They stated that information about home-equity products, for example, is important for understanding the total amount of debt and, in turn, default risk on a property.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A few consumer advocacy group commenters noted that open-end lines of credit, especially when fully drawn at account opening, can be interchangeable with closed-end products such as closed-end, subordinate-lien loans and cash-out refinancings. All such products provide borrowers with cash to do something, borrowers face the same risks of discrimination, and borrowers put their homes on the line in exchange for the funds. Commenters argued that requiring reporting of all dwelling-secured closed-end mortgage loans while continuing optional reporting of open-end lines of credit only would encourage more open-end lending, which in turn would decrease visibility into home-secured lending. Finally, one commenter noted that there is a lack of other publicly available information about dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A minority of industry commenters either supported (or stated that they did not oppose) reporting consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="197">Industry commenters unanimously opposed reporting dwelling-secured commercial-purpose open-end lines of credit. The Bureau addresses those comments in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(10).</footnote>
            A few of these commenters argued that eliminating optional open-end line of credit reporting for consumer-purpose credit lines would reduce confusion and compliance costs by streamlining reporting obligations, or would improve data for HMDA users. Some industry commenters believed that data about consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit would serve HMDA's purposes. For example, one industry commenter acknowledged that, even though reporting open-end lines of credit would be burdensome, the data reported would provide additional information for fair lending use.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A large number of industry commenters objected to mandatory reporting of consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit; a few of these commenters suggested that only credit lines for home purchase, home improvement or refinancing should be reported. Commenters generally asserted that mandatory reporting would impose significant burdens for little benefit. Some argued that the burdens are what have kept most financial institutions from voluntarily reporting home-equity line of credit data under current Regulation C. Financial institutions of various types and sizes objected to mandatory reporting, but smaller- or medium-sized banks and their industry associations, and credit unions and their industry associations, generally expressed the greatest concerns, with some stating that open-end coverage was their primary concern with the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A primary concern among many financial institutions and industry associations, and particularly among many credit unions and credit union associations, was the operational costs and burdens of collecting and reporting data about open-end lines of credit. The most commonly cited operational difficulty was that financial institutions treat open-end lines of credit more like consumer loans than mortgage loans. Thus, financial institutions frequently originate and maintain data about open-end lines of credit on different computer systems than traditional mortgages, or use different software vendors. Commenters asserted that upgrading, replacing, or programming their systems to enable open-end reporting would be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. For example, financial institutions could use their mortgage loan origination systems for open-end reporting, but those systems are more expensive than the consumer systems typically used for credit lines. Commenters noted that, if financial institutions decided to keep separate systems for open- and closed-end credit, they would incur costs from programming and adding data fields in multiple systems, as well as from compiling and aggregating the data. For some (smaller) institutions, aggregating the data would mean manually entering data from two different systems.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters similarly observed that financial institutions use different departments, staff, and processes to originate open-end lines of credit and traditional mortgages. Commenters argued that open-end reporting would require financial institutions to incur costs to change their operations. For example, consumer lending staff either would need to be trained on HMDA reporting, or credit line originations would need to be moved from the consumer- to the mortgage-lending divisions of financial institutions. Some commenters also argued that reporting open-end lines of credit would require institutions to spend even more time and money on quality control and pre-submission auditing and would increase the risk of errors.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A number of commenters perceived other types of operational burdens. For example, a few commenters emphasized that the reporting burden would be particularly great because it would be entirely new even for most current HMDA reporters, so infrastructure would need to be built from the ground up. A few commenters similarly worried that some institutions that focus on open-end lending would become HMDA reporters for the first time and would incur significant start-up expenses to begin reporting. Finally, some commenters noted that aligning open-end lending with the MISMO data standards would be burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters argued that reporting all open-end line of credit applications and originations would increase institutions' ongoing HMDA reporting costs because their volume of reportable transactions would increase significantly. Some commenters asserted that the proposal underestimated the increase. Only a handful of commenters specifically estimated how many additional applications and originations they would be required to report. Estimated increases ranged from 20 percent to 200 percent per institution, or from hundreds to thousands of transactions, depending on the institution's size and volume of open-end mortgage lending. Many commenters, particularly smaller institutions, stated that they would need to hire additional staff, or that they would need to allocate more money to technology and staff, to handle the volume increase. A few commenters estimated that collecting data about all dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit would double or triple their ongoing compliance costs.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Several commenters also argued that reporting open-end lines of credit would be burdensome because gathering and accurately reporting information about credit lines would be difficult. For example, several industry associations stated that fewer data are gathered from consumers for small-dollar, open-end credit lines than for traditional mortgages, so lenders would need to create systems and procedures to collect the data. One commenter further noted that lines of credit are consumer loan products with different offerings by different institutions and are less standardized than traditional mortgages. Another commenter pointed out that open-end lines of credit are exempt from other regulations because they are different than closed-end loans. Some commenters stated that it would be burdensome to determine whether, and if so how, data points apply to open-end lines of credit. These commenters asserted that reporting open-end lines of credit thus could increase reporting errors. A few of these commenters were particularly concerned about the Bureau's proposal to require information about the first draw on a home-equity line of credit.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many commenters argued that, in addition to being burdensome, reporting open-end lines of credit would have few benefits. First, many commenters asserted that mandatory reporting would exceed HMDA's mission and that the data reported would not serve HMDA's purposes. They argued that the data would not show whether financial institutions were meeting the housing needs of their communities because open-end lines of credit often are used for personal, non-housing-related, purposes (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> vacations, education, and bill consolidation). Some commenters argued that data about credit lines used for non-housing-related purposes would produce misleading information about mortgage markets and that reporting should be limited, at most, to credit lines for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes. Others asserted that, even if a consumer intended to use a line of credit for a housing-related purpose, such as home improvement, financial institutions could not know at account opening whether the borrower ever actually drew on the account or, if so, whether the funds were used for housing or other purposes. The commenters thus asserted that the data reported would not be useful.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters argued that data about open-end lines of credit would not serve HMDA's fair lending purpose, because borrowers taking out open-end credit lines borrow against the equity in their homes and are not fully assessed as new borrowers. A few commenters asserted that it was inappropriate for the Bureau to require open-end reporting for market monitoring and research purposes or to address safety and soundness concerns. One commenter argued that open-end lines of credit are less risky for consumers than closed-end loans, because they often are smaller, with smaller payments that are easier to make. Another argued that the change was not required by the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many commenters also argued that mandating reporting of open-end lines of credit would be of little benefit, because certain current and proposed data points (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> results from automated underwriting systems, some pricing data, and whether a transaction has non-amortizing features) would not apply to open-end credit. In addition, many commenters stated that mixing data about open-end, “consumer-purpose” transactions with traditional, closed-end mortgage loans will skew HMDA data and impair its integrity for HMDA users. Finally, a few commenters noted that the Board previously had considered and rejected mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit; these commenters asserted that the Board had found that open-end reporting would not serve HMDA's purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A few smaller financial institutions, credit unions, and credit union leagues predicted that they or other small institutions could be forced to stop offering open-end lines of credit. Others argued that adding open-end line of credit reporting would strain the limited resources of smaller banks and credit unions already struggling with burdensome compliance requirements, would inhibit such institutions from serving their customers, would increase costs to consumers and credit union members, or could force such institutions to exit the market for home-equity lines of credit, thereby reducing consumers' low-cost credit options.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Commenters suggested various alternatives to mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit. Some urged the Bureau to maintain optional reporting, while others asserted that open-end lines of credit should be excluded from reporting altogether. Some argued that smaller- or medium-sized banks and credit unions should be exempt from reporting, because small institutions did not cause the financial crisis and reporting would burden them unfairly. As noted, a few commenters urged the Bureau to require reporting only of open-end lines of credit for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments concerning mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit, and the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(o) largely as proposed, but without covering certain commercial-purpose lines of credit.<footnote ref="198">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.3(c)(10).</footnote>
            The Bureau is finalizing separate open-end line of credit coverage thresholds under § 1003.2(g) and § 1003.3(c)(12) to ensure that only financial institutions with a minimum level of open-end line of credit originations will be required to report.<footnote ref="199">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analyses of &amp;#167; 1003.2(g)(1)(v)(B) and (2)(ii)(B) and of &amp;#167; 1003.3(c)(12).</footnote>
            The Bureau acknowledges that, even with these modifications, many financial institutions may incur significant costs to report their open-end lines of credit, and that one-time costs may be particularly large. However, the Bureau believes that the benefits of mandatory reporting justify those costs.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes that including dwelling-secured lines of credit within the scope of Regulation C is a reasonable interpretation of HMDA section 303(2), which defines “mortgage loan” as a loan secured by residential real property or a home improvement loan. The Bureau interprets “mortgage loan” to include dwelling-secured lines of credit, as they are secured by residential real property and they may be used for home improvement purposes.<footnote ref="200">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51758-59 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            Moreover, pursuant to section 305(a) of HMDA, the Bureau believes that requiring reporting of all dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of HMDA and to prevent circumvention of evasion thereof.<footnote ref="201">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 51759.</footnote>
            HMDA and Regulation C are designed to provide citizens and public officials sufficient information about mortgage lending to ensure that financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities, to assist public officials in distributing public sector investments, and to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns. The Bureau believes that collecting information about all dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit serves these purposes.<footnote ref="202">Contrary to some commenters' assertions, the Board did not find that open-end reporting would not serve HMDA's purposes; rather, the Board in 2002 determined that the burdens of open-end reporting did not justify the benefits at that time.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>First, financial institutions will know, and the data will show, when an open-end line of credit is being taken out for the purpose of purchasing a home. This data alone will serve HMDA's purposes by providing information about how often, on what terms, and to which borrowers' institutions are originating open-end lines of credit to finance home purchases. Although many commenters argued that dwelling-secured lines of credit are used for purposes unrelated to housing, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, they often were made and fully drawn more or less simultaneously with first-lien home-purchase loans (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> as piggybacks), essentially creating high loan-to-value ratio home-purchase transactions that were not visible in the HMDA dataset.<footnote ref="203">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Donghoon Lee et al., Fed. Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report No. 569, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;A New Look at Second Liens,&lt;/em&gt; at 11 (Aug. 2012) (estimating that, prior to the crisis, as many as 45 percent of purchasers in coastal and bubble areas used a piggyback loan to subsidize the down payment on a first mortgage, hoping to eliminate the need for mortgage insurance).</footnote>
            Some evidence suggests that piggyback lending may be on the rise again now that the market has begun to recover from the crisis.<footnote ref="204">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Joe Light and AnnaMaria Andriotis, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Borrowers Tap Their Homes at a Hot Clip,&lt;/em&gt; Wall St. J., May 29, 2014), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/borrowers-tap-their-homes-at-a-hot-clip-1401407763&lt;/em&gt; (discussing the recent increase in home-equity line of credit lending and noting that some lenders have begun to bring back piggyback loans, which &amp;#8220;nearly vanished&amp;#8221; during the mortgage crisis).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Second, the data will help to understand how often, on what terms, and to which borrowers institutions are originating open-end lines of credit for home improvement purposes. It is true, as many commenters argued, that funds from lines of credit may be used for many purposes, and that lenders cannot track how funds ultimately are used. However, the same is true of funds obtained through cash-out refinancings, which currently are reported under Regulation C, and through closed-end home-equity loans and reverse mortgages, some of which are reportable today and all of which will be reportable under the final rule (unless an exception applies).<footnote ref="205">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(q), commenters raised some of the same concerns about reverse mortgages. The final rule requires reporting of all reverse mortgages for the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(q).</footnote>
            Funds from all of these products may be used for personal purposes, but they may also be used for home improvement (and home purchase) purposes. Citizens and public officials long have analyzed data about such products to understand how financial institutions are satisfying borrowers' needs for home improvement lending.<footnote ref="206">For example, financial institutions currently report closed-end home-equity loans when borrowers indicate that some or all of the funds will be used for home improvement purposes. Financial institutions, however, do not track what portion (if any) of the funds ultimately are used for that purpose. No data reporting regime can provide perfect information; the information that is reported nevertheless assists in serving HMDA's purposes.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that financial institutions serve the housing needs of their communities not only by providing fair and adequate financing to purchase and improve homes, but also by ensuring that neither individual borrowers nor particular communities are excessively overleveraged through open-end home-equity borrowing. The Bureau thus declines to limit reporting of open-end mortgage lending to transactions for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes, as some commenters suggested. Open-end home-equity lending, regardless of how the funds are used, liquefies equity that borrowers have built up in their homes, which often are their most important assets. Borrowers who take out dwelling-secured credit lines increase their risk of losing their homes to foreclosure when property values decline.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Indeed, as discussed in the proposal, open-end line of credit originations expanded significantly during the mid-2000s, particularly in areas with high home-price appreciation, and research indicates that speculative real estate investors used open-end lines of credit to purchase non-owner-occupied investment properties, which correlated with higher first mortgage defaults and home-price depreciation.<footnote ref="207">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51757 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            In short, overleverage due to open-end mortgage lending and defaults on dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit contributed to the foreclosure crises that many communities experienced in the late 2000s. Communities' housing needs would have been better served if these crises could have been avoided (or remedied more quickly).<footnote ref="208">As noted in the proposal, many public and private mortgage relief programs encountered unique difficulties assisting distressed borrowers who had obtained subordinate-lien loans, including dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51757 (Aug. 29, 2014).</footnote>
            Had open-end line of credit data been reported in HMDA, the public and public officials could have had a much earlier warning of potential risks. The Bureau believes that obtaining data about open-end mortgage lending remains critical, with open-end lending on the rise once again as home prices have begun to recover from the financial crisis.<footnote ref="209">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Press Release, Equifax, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;First Quarter Mortgage Originations Soar&lt;/em&gt; (June 29, 2015), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://investor.equifax.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=919892&lt;/em&gt; (stating that more than 285,700 new accounts were originated during the first quarter of 2015, a year-over-year increase of 21.2 percent and the highest level since 2008); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;CBA, Icon Market Analysis Finds Growing Consumer Demand for Home Equity Lines of Credit&lt;/em&gt; (Mar. 23, 2015) (home-equity line of credit originations have increased in each of the past 13 quarters, with annual growth of nearly 22 percent in both 2013 and 2014 and an increase of 36 percent for the first quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of 2014); Joe Light and AnnaMaria Andriotis, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Borrowers Tap Their Homes at a Hot Clip,&lt;/em&gt; Wall St. J., May 29, 2014), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/borrowers-tap-their-homes-at-a-hot-clip-1401407763&lt;/em&gt; (quoting the chief economist of Equifax Inc. that lenders had begun marketing more aggressively in areas where home prices had recovered and that originations had picked up as consumers had returned to home improvement projects postponed during the crisis).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit will help to understand whether all dwelling-secured credit is extended on equitable terms. It may be true, as some commenters asserted, that borrowers are not necessarily evaluated for open-end credit in the same manner as for traditional mortgage loans and that adequate home equity is the key consideration. Lending practices during the financial crisis demonstrated, however, that during prolonged periods of home-price appreciation, lenders became increasingly comfortable originating home-equity products to borrowers with less and less equity to spare. The more leveraged the borrower, the more at risk the borrower is of losing his or her home. Obtaining data about open-end mortgage lending could show, during future housing booms, whether such risky lending practices are concentrated among certain borrowers or communities and permit the public and public officials to respond appropriately. In this and other ways, data about open-end lines of credit will help to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Certain commenters pointed out that several data points will not apply to open-end lines of credit. However, the Bureau believes that the public and public officials will receive valuable information from all of the data points that do apply. With applicable data points, HMDA users will have, for the first time, good information about which financial institutions are originating open-end lines of credit, how frequently, on what terms, and to which borrowers. HMDA users will be able to evaluate whether, and how, financial institutions are using open-end lines of credit to serve the housing needs of their communities. Moreover, as discussed below, the final rule adopts several measures to minimize the burdens to financial institutions of determining whether and how data points apply to open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="210">Some commenters were concerned that financial institutions would be required to report the portion of the open-end line of credit that would be used for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing purposes. However, the final rule, like the proposal, requires financial institutions to report the total amount of the line at account opening. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(7).</footnote>

            The final rule also requires financial institutions to flag whether a transaction is for closed- or open-end credit. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1003.4(a)(37). This flag addresses commenters' concerns about commingling information about closed-end mortgage loans and open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="211">Indeed, commingling of information is more a of problem under existing Regulation C than it will be under the final rule, because there currently is no way for users of HMDA data to distinguish information about optionally reported open-end lines of credit from the rest of the HMDA dataset.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Not only will data about open-end lines of credit help to serve HMDA's purposes, but the Bureau believes that expanding the scope of Regulation C to include dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose lines of credit is necessary to prevent evasion of HMDA. As discussed in the proposal, consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit may be interchangeable with consumer-purpose closed-end home-equity products, many of which currently are reported, and all of which will be reported, under final § 1003.2(d) and (e). The Bureau believes that, if open- and closed-end consumer-purpose home-equity products are treated differently under the final rule, there is a heightened risk that financial institutions could steer borrowers to open-end products to avoid HMDA reporting.<footnote ref="212">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51758 (Aug. 29, 2014). The Bureau believes the risk of steering is highlighted by lending practices described during the Board's 2010 Hearings; for example, one individual described how a loan officer persuaded her to open a home-equity line of credit simultaneously with her primary mortgage, even though she had not inquired about or been interested in opening a line of credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
            The Bureau believes that steering could be particularly attractive (and risky for borrowers) given that open-end lines of credit are not subject to the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule and currently are subject to less complete disclosure requirements than closed-end products under Regulation Z. The Bureau believes that some financial institutions likely would attempt to evade Regulation C if mandatory reporting were not adopted for open-end lines of credit. The Bureau thus has determined that, in addition to being a reasonable interpretation of the statute, requiring reporting of dwelling-secured, consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit also is authorized as an adjustment that is necessary and proper to prevent evasion of HMDA.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that reporting open-end lines of credit will impose one-time and ongoing operational costs on reporting institutions. The proposal estimated that the one-time costs of modifying processes and systems and training staff to begin open-end line of credit reporting likely would impose significant costs on some institutions, and that institutions' ongoing reporting costs would increase as a function of their open-end lending volume.<footnote ref="213">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 51825-26, 51836-37 (estimating the one-time and ongoing costs, respectively, to low-, medium-, and high-complexity institutions of reporting open-end lines of credit, all dwelling-secured home-equity loans, and reverse mortgages).</footnote>
            As discussed above, many commenters emphasized both these one-time and ongoing costs.<footnote ref="214">Certain commenters argued that the proposal underestimated the costs of reporting open-end lines of credit. Those comments are addressed in part VII, along with the methodology the Bureau has used to estimate the costs of open-end reporting, and the challenges the Bureau has faced in developing its estimates.</footnote>
            The Bureau acknowledges these costs and understands that many institutions' reportable transaction volume many increase significantly.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g), and in part VII below, the Bureau has faced challenges developing accurate estimates of the likely impact on institutional and transactional coverage of mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit due to the lack of available data concerning open-end lending. These challenges affect the Bureau's ability to develop reliable one-time and ongoing cost estimates, as well, because such costs are a function of both the number of institutions reporting open-end data and the number of transactions each of those institutions reports.<footnote ref="215">The Bureau solicited information that would assist it in making these estimates and in determining whether the estimates provided in the proposal were accurate, but commenters generally did not provide responsive data. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 51731, 51754 (Aug. 29, 2014). Some commenters argued, based on their particular institution's lending volume, that the Bureau underestimated the number of open-end lines of credit that institutions would be required to report. As discussed in part VII, the proposal's and the final rule's estimates of transaction volumes are averages. Thus, they may be low for some financial institutions and high for others. Moreover, some industry commenters did not distinguish between consumer- and commercial-purpose credit lines. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.3(c)(10), the final rule requires financial institutions to report only a subset of commercial-purpose lines of credit. Thus, it is possible that some commenters overestimated the number of open-end transactions that they would report under the final rule. Based on available information, including the feedback provided by commenters, the Bureau cannot definitively conclude whether the proposal significantly underestimated reportable open-end line of credit volume as a general matter.</footnote>
            After careful analysis, the Bureau has developed estimates of open-end line of credit origination volumes by institutions and, as discussed in part VII, has used those estimates to estimate both the overall one-time and overall ongoing costs to institutions of open-end reporting.<footnote ref="216">As noted in part VII, with currently available sources, the Bureau can reliably estimate: (1) Total open-end line of credit originations in the market and (2) subordinate-lien open-end line of credit originations by credit union. Both of these estimates are under- and over-inclusive of the open-end transactions that are reportable under the final rule. Neither includes applications that do not result in originations, which will be reported, and both include commercial-purpose lines of credit, many of which will be excluded under final § 1003.3(c)(10). For banks and thrifts, the Bureau's estimates of open-end line of credit originations have been extrapolated from several data sources using simplified assumptions and may not accurately reflect open-end lending by such institutions.</footnote>
            The Bureau expects that both one-time and ongoing costs will be larger for more complex financial institutions that have higher open-end lending volume and that will need to integrate separate business lines, data platforms, and systems, to begin reporting open-end lending. Precisely because no good source of publicly available data exists concerning dwelling-secured open-end lines of credit, it is difficult to predict the accuracy of the Bureau's cost estimates, but the Bureau believes that they are reasonably reliable and acknowledges that, for many lenders, the costs of open-end reporting may be significant. As discussed further below, the final rule revises the proposal in several ways to reduce open-end reporting costs for certain financial institutions.<footnote ref="217">The Bureau does not believe that open-end reporters will incur burden from aligning with MISMO. As discussed in part VII, the Bureau did not propose to require, and the final rule does not require, any financial institution to use or become familiar with the MISMO data standards. Rather, the rule merely recognizes that many financial institutions are already using the MISMO data standards for collecting and transmitting mortgage data and uses similar definitions for certain data points to reduce burden for those institutions.</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A few commenters argued that reporting open-end lines of credit will be difficult because financial institutions collect less information from consumers when originating open-end products than when originating traditional, closed-end mortgage loans. In part, this may be because open-end lines of credit are not subject to the Bureau's 2013 ATR Final Rule. However, the Bureau believes that this lack of substantive regulation only strengthens the need for open-end line of credit reporting in HMDA so that the public and policymakers have sufficient data about the dwelling-secured open-end credit market to understand whether lenders offering open-end products are serving the housing needs of their communities.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>Methods To Reduce the Burden of Open-End Line of Credit Reporting</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing mandatory reporting of dwelling-secured consumer-purpose open-end lines of credit because of the many benefits discussed above. The Bureau is adopting several measures to address commenters' concerns about the burdens of implementing open-end reporting and their concerns about ongoing open-end reporting costs.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Institutional coverage threshold.</em> As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g), the Bureau is finalizing a separate, open-end institutional coverage threshold to determine whether an institution is a HMDA reporter. As discussed in that section, the Bureau concluded that its proposed institutional coverage test achieved appropriate market coverage of closed-end mortgage lending. However, in light of the costs associated with open-end reporting, the Bureau was concerned that finalizing the proposed institutional coverage test would have required institutions with sufficient closed-end—but very little open-end—mortgage lending to incur costs to begin open-end reporting. The Bureau thus is adopting an institutional coverage test that covers a financial institution only if (in addition to meeting the other criteria under § 1003.2(g)) it originated either (1) 25 or more closed-end mortgage loans or (2) 100 or more open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g), the Bureau believes that the 25 closed-end and 100 open-end loan-volume origination tests appropriately balance the benefits and burdens of covering institutions based on their closed- and open-end mortgage lending, respectively. Specifically, as discussed further in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(g) and in part VII, the Bureau estimates that adopting a 100-open-end line of credit threshold will avoid imposing the burden of establishing open-end reporting on approximately 3,000 predominantly smaller-sized institutions with low open-end lending compared to the proposal, while still requiring reporting of a significant majority of dwelling-secured, open-end line of credit originations. As discussed in those sections, the Bureau also believes that all institutions that will be required to report open-end line of credit data are current HMDA reporters.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Transactional coverage threshold.</em> The final rule also adds in § 1003.3(c)(12) a transactional coverage threshold for open-end mortgage lending. The transactional coverage threshold is designed to work in tandem with the open-end institutional coverage threshold in § 1003.2(g). Specifically, § 1003.3(c)(12) provides that a financial institution that originated fewer than 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the preceding two calendar years is not required to report data about its open-end lines of credit, even if the financial institution otherwise is a financial institution under § 1003.2(g) because of its closed-end lending (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> even if the institution will be reporting data about closed-end mortgage loans).<footnote ref="218">For balance, the Bureau is adopting a parallel transactional coverage threshold for closed-end mortgage loans in § 1003.3(c)(11). Under § 1003.3(c)(11), a financial institution that originated fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the preceding two calendar years is not required to report data about its closed-end mortgage loans, even if the financial institution otherwise is a financial institution under § 1003.2(g) because of its open-end mortgage lending (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; even if the institution will be reporting data about open-end lines of credit).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Effective date.</em> The Bureau is mindful that most financial institutions have never reported open-end mortgage lending data, that collecting and reporting such data for the first time will be time-consuming and complex, and that implementation costs may be sensitive to the time permitted to complete the required changes. The Bureau thus is providing financial institutions approximately two years to complete the changes necessary to begin collecting the data required under the final rule, including data about open-end lines of credit. As noted in part VI, financial institutions will report the data required under the final rule for actions taken on covered loans on or after January 1, 2018.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Other efforts to mitigate burden.</em> Some of the anticipated burdens of reporting open-end lines of credit also likely will be mitigated by the operational enhancements and modifications that the Bureau is exploring for HMDA reporting generally. For example, as discussed elsewhere in the final rule, the Bureau is improving the edit and submission process, which should reduce reporting burden for all covered loans. While these improvements will not reduce the costs that financial institutions will incur to adapt their systems and processes to report open-end lines of credit, they should reduce ongoing costs to institutions by reducing the amount of time financial institutions may spend submitting and editing this data.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Clarifying which data points apply to open-end lines of credit, and how they apply, also will alleviate compliance burden. For example, commenters expressed concern about reporting information about initial draws under open-end lines of credit. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.4(a)(39), the Bureau is not finalizing that data point, in part in response to commenters' concerns. The final rule also provides that several other data points do not apply to open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="219">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(4) (preapproval request); &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(18) (origination charges); &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(19) (discount points); and &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(20) (lender credits).</footnote>
            Finally, the final rule provides guidance about how several data points apply to open-end lines of credit.<footnote ref="220">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(7)(ii) and comment 4(a)(7)-6 (loan amount); comments 4(a)(12)-3 and -4 (rate spread); &amp;#167; 1003.4(a)(17) (total points and fees); comment 4(a)(25)-4 (amortization term); and comment 4(a)(26)-1 (introductory rate).</footnote>

                    <title>Open-End Line of Credit Definition</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a few technical revisions to streamline § 1003.2(o) and to align it with revisions made elsewhere in the final rule. Proposed § 1003.2(o) provided that an open-end line of credit was a dwelling-secured transaction that was neither a closed-end mortgage loan under proposed § 1003.2(d) nor a reverse mortgage under proposed § 1003.2(q). To align with lending practices, to streamline the definitions of closed-end mortgage loan and open-end line of credit, and to streamline § 1003.4(a)(36) (which requires financial institutions to identify reverse mortgages), the final rule eliminates the mutual exclusivity between open-end lines of credit and reverse mortgages. Final § 1003.2(o) thus provides that an open-end line of credit is an extension of credit that (1) is secured by a lien on a dwelling; and (2) is an open-end credit plan as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(20), but without regard to whether the credit is consumer credit, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(12), is extended by a creditor, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(17), or is extended to a consumer, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(11).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Consistent with § 1003.2(d), final § 1003.2(o) provides that an open-end line of credit is a dwelling-secured “extension of credit.” New comment 2(o)-2 clarifies the meaning of the term “extension of credit” for open-end transactions for purposes of § 1003.2(o). It states that financial institutions may cross-reference the guidance concerning “extension of credit” under § 1003.2(d) and comment 2(d)-2, and it provides an example of an open-end transaction that is not an extension of credit and thus not covered under the final rule. It further clarifies that, for purposes of § 1003.2(o), each draw on an open-end line of credit is not an extension of credit. Thus, financial institutions report covered open-end lines of credit only once, at account opening.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Prior to the proposal, the Bureau received feedback that Regulation C's definition of refinancing was confusing. To address those concerns, the Bureau proposed § 1003.2(p) and related commentary. Proposed § 1003.2(p) streamlined the existing definition of refinancing by moving the portion of the definition that addresses institutional coverage to proposed § 1003.2(g), the definition of “financial institution.” For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is adopting § 1003.2(p) largely as proposed, and is adopting revised commentary to § 1003.2(p) to provide additional guidance about the types of transactions that are refinancings under Regulation C.<footnote ref="221">Prior to the proposal and in public comments on the proposal, the Bureau received feedback that agricultural-purpose refinancings should be excluded from Regulation C's coverage. The final rule clarifies that all agricultural-purpose transactions, whether for home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or some other purpose, are excluded transactions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.3(c)(9).</footnote>

                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on proposed § 1003.2(p) and its accompanying commentary from financial institutions, industry trade associations, and other industry participants. The comments generally supported the Bureau's proposed revisions, but several commenters suggested different definitions or additional clarifications.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received only a few comments addressing proposed § 1003.2(p)'s regulation text, all from industry participants. One commenter specifically supported the Bureau's proposal to move the “coverage prong” of § 1003.2(p) to the definition of financial institution in § 1003.2(g) and stated that the move would reduce confusion. Another commenter suggested that the Bureau could reduce compliance costs by aligning the definition of refinancing in proposed § 1003.2(p) with Regulation Z § 1026.37(a)(9), so that a refinancing is any transaction that is not a home purchase loan and that satisfies and replaces an existing obligation secured by the same property. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.4(a)(3), the final rule does not include this modification.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comment 2(p)-1 generally as proposed, but with several non-substantive revisions for clarity. In addition, final comment 2(p)-1 is modified to provide that a refinancing occurs only when the original debt obligation has been satisfied and replaced by a new debt obligation, based on the parties' contract and applicable law. This is consistent with the definition of refinancing in Regulation Z § 1026.20(a) and comment 20(a)-1. The comment further specifies that satisfaction of the original lien, as distinct from the debt obligation, is irrelevant in determining whether a refinancing has occurred. A few commenters requested that the Bureau provide additional guidance concerning loan modifications and renewals, stating that examiners provide inconsistent guidance about whether to report renewal transactions when there is no new note. Accordingly, final comment 2(p)-1 specifies that a new debt obligation that renews or modifies the terms of, but does not satisfy and replace, an existing debt obligation is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p).<footnote ref="222">To further address uncertainty about the types of transactions that are reportable under Regulation C, the final rule also clarifies in the commentary to § 1003.2(d) (definition of closed-end mortgage loan) and (o) (definition of open-end line of credit) that loan modifications and renewals are not “extensions of credit” under Regulation C and thus are not reportable transactions under the final rule. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of &amp;#167; 1003.2(d) and (o).</footnote>
            
          </analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d), the final rule considers a transaction completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and classified as a supplemental mortgage under N.Y. Tax Law § 255 such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes to be an “extension of credit” and therefore reportable. The final rule adds new comment 2(p)-2 to provide that a transaction is considered a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) where: (1) The transaction is completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and is classified as a supplemental mortgage under N.Y. Tax Law § 255 such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, and (2) but for the agreement the transaction would have met the definition of a refinancing under § 1003.2(p).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received one comment addressing proposed comment 2(p)-2. The comment requested that the Bureau eliminate from the definition of refinancing the requirement that both the existing and the new debt obligations be dwelling-secured, because it is burdensome to confirm whether the new transaction pays off an existing mortgage. This requirement, however, is consistent with Regulation Z's definition of refinancing. The Bureau notes that, under the final rule, whether a consumer-purpose transaction meets this test (or, for that matter, whether such a transaction otherwise is a refinancing) no longer determines whether the transaction is a covered loan.<footnote ref="223">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.3(c)(10), Regulation C's existing purpose-based coverage test applies to business- or commercial-purpose transactions under the final rule.</footnote>
            Thus, for consumer-purpose transactions, when a financial institution originates a dwelling-secured debt obligation that satisfies and replaces an existing debt obligation, the financial institution no longer needs to determine whether the existing debt obligation was dwelling-secured to know that the transaction is HMDA-reportable. The financial institution will, however, need to determine whether the existing debt obligation was dwelling-secured to determine whether to report the transaction as a refinancing or an “other purpose” transaction. See § 1003.4(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing proposed comment 2(p)-3 generally as proposed, with minor modifications for clarity, and renumbered as comment 2(p)-4. The Bureau received a few comments addressing proposed comment 2(p)-3. One financial institution specifically supported the proposed commentary, but another asked for additional guidance for situations, such as a divorce, where only one of the original borrowers is obligated on the new loan. As proposed, comment 2(p)-3 addressed this scenario. It specified that, if one debt obligation to two borrowers was satisfied and replaced by a new debt obligation to either one of the original borrowers, then the new obligation was a refinancing, assuming the other requirements of proposed § 1003.2(p) were met. Proposed comment 2(p)-3 also specified that, if two spouses were divorcing, and a debt obligation of only one spouse was satisfied and replaced by a new debt obligation of only the other spouse, then the transaction was not a refinancing under proposed § 1002.3(p). Final comment 2(p)-4 retains these examples but revises and expands them for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Several commenters asked whether two or more new loans that are originated to satisfy and replace one existing loan are refinancings. The final rule adopts new comment 2(p)-5 to clarify that each of the two new obligations is a refinancing if, taken together, they satisfy and replace the existing obligation. Comment 2(p)-5 also specifies that the same rule applies when one new loan satisfies and replaces two or more existing debt obligations.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The final rule adds new comment 2(p)-6 to clarify that a transaction that meets the definition of a refinancing may also be used for other purposes. The comment provides an illustrative example and specifies that instructions for reporting a multiple-purpose covered loan are in the commentary to § 1003.4(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1003.2(q) added a “reverse mortgage” definition to Regulation C. Regulation C currently requires financial institutions to report a reverse mortgage if it otherwise is reportable as a home purchase loan, a home improvement loan, or a refinancing. The current regulation, however, does not define “reverse mortgage” or require financial institutions to identify which applications or loans are for reverse mortgages. The proposed definition generally provided that a reverse mortgage is a reverse mortgage transaction as defined under Regulation Z § 1026.33(a). Taken together with proposed § 1003.2(e) (definition of “covered loan”), proposed § 1003.2(q) effectively provided that all reverse mortgage transactions, regardless of their purpose, were covered loans and HMDA-reportable.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments about proposed § 1003.2(q) and coverage of reverse mortgages. While consumer advocacy group commenters generally supported the proposal, industry participants that discussed proposed § 1003.2(q) generally opposed expanding coverage of reverse mortgages. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(q) substantially as proposed, with minor technical revisions.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A number of consumer advocacy groups supported the Bureau's proposed reverse mortgage definition. They stated that having data about all reverse mortgages would be valuable in assessing whether the neighborhoods that they serve are receiving the full range of credit that the neighborhoods need and would be appropriate to ensure an adequate understanding of the mortgage market. These commenters stated that publicly available data about all reverse mortgages will be essential in the coming years as the country's population ages and older consumers, many of whom are cash-poor but own their homes outright, may increasingly use home equity for living expenses and other purposes. The commenters noted that reverse mortgages often are not reported under current Regulation C because they often are not for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The commenters further noted that Regulation C's reverse mortgage data lack information about open-end, reverse mortgage transactions. Having data about “other purpose” reverse mortgages, as well as open-end reverse mortgages, will help to determine how the housing needs of seniors are being met. This is particularly true because poorly structured or higher-priced reverse mortgages can result in financial hardship to seniors. The commenters also noted the general importance of having data about housing-related transactions to older consumers, who may be particularly vulnerable to predatory or discriminatory lending practices. Several of these commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a flag to identify reverse mortgages. One industry commenter generally supported proposed § 1003.2(q). The commenter agreed that the proposed definition of reverse mortgage was appropriate because it aligned with Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including trade associations, several financial institutions, and a compliance professional, disagreed with the Bureau's proposal to require reporting of all reverse mortgages. Some of these commenters asserted that Regulation C should not apply to reverse mortgages at all, or that reverse mortgages are outside the scope of HMDA. Others argued that the Bureau should maintain current coverage of reverse mortgages and require them to be reported only if they are for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The commenters generally argued that reporting all reverse mortgages would create new costs for financial institutions and that the burdens did not justify the benefits.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Regarding burden, commenters stated that reverse mortgage lenders already are exiting the market because of regulatory demands and uncertainties with reverse mortgages, and that requiring reporting of all reverse mortgages under HMDA would continue that trend. A few commenters argued that data for reverse mortgages is kept on separate systems from traditional mortgage loans and that it would be costly and time-consuming to upgrade systems for reporting. Some commenters stated that the burden would be particularly great for reverse mortgage lenders that make fewer than 100 mortgages in a year.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>These commenters argued that the benefits of reporting all reverse mortgages would be small. They stated that financial institutions already report the necessary data about reverse mortgages (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> data about closed-end reverse mortgages for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing). They stated that HMDA does not require data about other types of reverse mortgages, which are used for purposes unrelated to housing finance. They also stated that many of HMDA's data points (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> points and fees and debt-to-income ratio) do not apply, or apply differently, to reverse mortgages than to traditional mortgages. The commenters asserted that the data reported thus would have large gaps and would not clarify whether financial institutions are meeting the housing needs of their communities. Some commenters noted that the reverse mortgage market currently is small and that many financial institutions do not offer reverse mortgages, so the value of the data reported would be low.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some commenters stated that comparing reverse mortgage data with data for traditional mortgage loans or lines of credit would lead only to inaccurate conclusions about reverse mortgage originations because, for example, reverse mortgages are underwritten and priced differently than other mortgages and are for different purposes. Other commenters noted that the Bureau has exempted reverse mortgages from other rulemakings, such as the 2013 ATR Final Rule and the Bureau's Integrated Mortgage Disclosures rule (2013 TILA-RESPA Final Rule),<footnote ref="224">78 FR 79730 (Dec. 31, 2013).</footnote>
            given their differences from traditional mortgages. Finally, one commenter noted that there would be no harm in the Bureau delaying reverse mortgage reporting until after the Bureau has reviewed and considered other reverse mortgage rulemakings.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1003.2(q) generally as proposed, with minor technical revisions. The Bureau acknowledges that requiring reporting of data on additional transactions will impose burden on financial institutions, but the Bureau believes that the benefits of reporting justify the burdens.

            As discussed in the proposal, communities have faced risks due to reverse mortgage lending, particularly communities with sizable populations of borrowers eligible for reverse mortgages programs,<footnote ref="227">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; (citing Susan Taylor Martin, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Complexities of Reverse Mortgages Snag Homeowners,&lt;/em&gt; Tampa Bay Times, May 30, 2014; Kevin Burbach &amp;amp; Sharon Schmickle, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;As State Ages, Minnesota Braces for Problems With Risky Reverse-Mortgages,&lt;/em&gt; MinnPost (April 5, 2013), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.minnpost.com/business/2013/04/state-ages-minnesota-braces-problems-risky-reverse-mortgages&lt;/em&gt; ; and HUD Presentation, Nat'l Reverse Mortgage Lenders Ass'n Eastern Regional Meeting (Mar. 26, 2012) (noting that 8.1 and 9.4 percent of active Home Equity Conversion Mortgage loans were in default in July 2011 and February 2012, respectively).</footnote>

                  <analysisParagraph>Information on all reverse mortgages, regardless of purpose, would help communities understand the risks posed to local housing markets, thereby providing the citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether financial institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located. Furthermore, private institutions and nonprofit organizations, as well as local, State, and Federal programs, traditionally have facilitated or engaged in reverse mortgage lending. However, the proprietary market for reverse mortgages has substantially declined in recent years. Thus, requiring improved information regarding all reverse mortgages would assist public officials in their determination of the distribution of public sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private investment environment.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Indeed, it is particularly important to obtain better information about the reverse mortgage market because it serves older consumers, a traditionally vulnerable population. State officials provided feedback during the Board's 2010 Hearings that expanding the transactional coverage of Regulation C to include all reverse mortgages would assist in the identification of discriminatory and other potentially harmful practices against this protected class.<footnote ref="229">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 51760 (citing New York State Banking Department comment letter, Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve System docket no. OP-1388, p. 5, submitted Aug. 6, 2010; San Francisco Hearing, Remarks of Preston DuFauchard, Commissioner of the California Department of Corporations).</footnote>
            In this regard, the Bureau notes that requiring reporting of all reverse mortgages dovetails with the Dodd-Frank Act's requirement to report age for all covered loans. The Bureau believes that the currently small size of the market, and the fact that the Bureau may address reverse mortgages in future, substantive rulemakings, further support the decision to require reverse mortgage reporting as soon as possible. The flow of information to the public and policymakers will better position them to identify housing needs and market developments as they occur.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that, as commenters observed, reverse mortgages are underwritten and priced differently than other mortgages, some data points apply differently to reverse mortgages, and some do not apply at all. However, this is just as true for the reverse mortgages that currently are reported (and that most commenters agree should be reported) as for the reverse mortgages that will be added under the final rule. Where possible, the Bureau has provided additional guidance to instruct financial institutions how particular data points apply to reverse mortgages. Finally, the Bureau is adopting a flag to ensure that data reported for reverse mortgages will not be commingled unknowingly with data reported for other covered loans. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.4(a)(36).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The final rule modifies proposed § 1003.2(q) to specify that a reverse mortgage is a reverse mortgage transaction as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.33(a), but without regard to whether the security interest is created in a principal dwelling. Thus, under Regulation C, a transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a reverse mortgage must be reported even if the security interest is taken in, for example, the borrower's second residence.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Section 1003.2(q) also contains one revision to align the definition with other changes being adopted in the final rule. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1003.2(d) and (o), the proposal provided that closed-end mortgage loans and open-end lines of credit were mutually exclusive of reverse mortgages, and thus a covered loan under proposed § 1003.2(e) was a closed-end mortgage loan, an open-end line of credit, or a reverse mortgage that was not otherwise excluded under proposed § 1003.3(c). The final rule eliminates the mutual exclusivity between: (1) Closed-end mortgage loans and open-end lines of credit and (2) reverse mortgages. Thus, the final rule both eliminates reverse mortgages as a category of covered loans under § 1003.2(e) and eliminates the cross-reference to § 1003.2(e) from the reverse mortgage definition.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Final § 1003.2(q) is adopted pursuant to the Bureau's authority under section 305(a) of HMDA. For the reasons given above, the Bureau believes that including reverse mortgages within the scope of the regulation is a reasonable interpretation of HMDA section 303(2), which defines “mortgage loan” to mean a loan which is secured by residential real property or a home improvement loan. The Bureau interprets that term to include reverse mortgages, as those transactions are secured by residential real property, and they may be used for home improvement. In addition, pursuant to its authority under section 305(a) of HMDA, the Bureau believes that this proposed adjustment is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of HMDA, to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, and to facilitate compliance therewith. For the reasons given above, by requiring all financial institutions to report information regarding reverse mortgages, this proposed modification would ensure that the citizens and public officials of the United States are provided with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether depository institutions are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which they are located. Furthermore, as reverse mortgages are a common method of obtaining credit, this proposed modification would assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.</analysisParagraph>

          		<content>There are five aggregate race categories: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and White. The Asian and the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate categories have seven and four subcategories, respectively. The Asian race subcategories are: Asian Indian; Chinese, Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian. The Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander race subcategories are: Native Hawaiian; Guamanian or Chamorro; Samoan; and Other Pacific Islander. You must report every aggregate race category selected by the applicant. If the applicant also selects one or more race subcategories, you must report each race subcategory selected by the applicant, except that you must not report more than a total of five aggregate race categories and race subcategories combined. For example, if the applicant selects all five aggregate race categories and also selects some race subcategories, you report only the five aggregate race categories. On the other hand, if the applicant selects the White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate race categories, and the applicant also selects the Korean, Vietnamese, and Samoan race subcategories, you must report White, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and any two, at your option, of the three race subcategories selected by the applicant. In this example, you must report White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and in addition you must report (at your option) either Korean and Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan, or Vietnamese and Samoan. To determine how to report an Other race subcategory for purposes of the five-race maximum, see paragraph 9.iv below.</content>

In either such case, you must report both the selection of Other Asian or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable, and the additional information provided by the applicant, subject to the five-race maximum. In all such cases where the applicant has selected an Other race subcategory and also provided additional information, for purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined set forth above, the Other race subcategory and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection. Thus, using the same facts in the example offered in paragraph 9.iii above, if the applicant also selected Other Asian and entered “Thai” in the space provided, Other Asian and Thai are considered one selection. You must report any two (at your option) of the four race subcategories selected by the applicant, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian-Thai, and Samoan, in addition to the three aggregate race categories selected by the applicant.</content>

When you collect an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on the basis of visual observation or surname, you must select from the following aggregate categories: Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino; not Hispanic or Latino); race (American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; White); sex (male; female).</content>

              <content>Consistency with Regulation B. Bureau interpretations that appear in the official commentary to Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity <ref target="1003-2-a" reftype="term">Act</ref>, <ref target="CFR:12-1002" reftype="external">12 CFR part 1002</ref>, Supplement I) are generally applicable to the definition of application under Regulation C.

              <content>Prequalification. A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a request for preapproval) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective loan applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan application process; others use the same process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to report prequalification requests on the loan/application register, even though these requests may constitute applications under Regulation B for purposes of adverse action notices.</content>

              <content>Requests for preapproval. To be a preapproval program as defined in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref>, the written commitment issued under the program must result from a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the applicant, including such verification of income, resources, and other matters as is typically done by the institution as part of its normal credit evaluation program. In addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable property and verification that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage application approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home. Regardless of its name, a program that satisfies the definition of a preapproval program in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. Conversely, a program that a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> describes as a “preapproval program” that does not satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is not a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. If a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> does not regularly use the procedures specified in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref>, but instead considers requests for preapprovals on an ad hoc basis, the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> need not treat ad hoc requests as part of a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. A <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should, however, be generally consistent in following uniform procedures for considering such ad hoc requests.</content>

Section <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> defines a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> as an extension of credit that is secured by a lien on a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> and that is not an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="internal">1003.2(o)</ref>. Thus, for example, a loan to purchase a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> and secured only by a personal guarantee is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> because it is not <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>-secured.</content>

              <content>Extension of credit. Under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref>, a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>-secured loan is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> unless it involves an extension of credit. Thus, some transactions completed pursuant to installment sales contracts, such as some land contracts, are not <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loans</ref> because no credit is extended. For example, if a land contract provides that, upon default, the contract terminates, all previous payments will be treated as rent, and the borrower is under no obligation to make further payments, the transaction is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref>. In general, extension of credit under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> refers to the granting of credit only pursuant to a new debt obligation. Thus, except as described in comments 2(d)-2.i and .ii, if a transaction modifies, renews, extends, or amends the terms of an existing debt obligation, but the existing debt obligation is not satisfied and replaced, the transaction is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> because there has been no new extension of credit.

                <content>Assumptions. For purposes of Regulation C, an assumption is a transaction in which an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower in place of an existing borrower as the obligor on an existing debt obligation. For purposes of Regulation C, assumptions include successor-in-interest transactions, in which an individual succeeds the prior owner as the property owner and then assumes the existing debt secured by the property. Under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref>, assumptions are extensions of credit even if the new borrower merely assumes the existing debt obligation and no new debt obligation is created.

Aside from these distinctions, institutions may rely on <ref target="CFR:12-1026-2" reftype="external">12 CFR 1026.2</ref>(a)(20) and its related commentary in determining whether a transaction is an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="internal">1003.2(o)</ref>. For example, assume a business-purpose transaction that is exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to § 1026.3(a)(1) but that otherwise is open-end credit under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20). The business-purpose transaction is an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> under Regulation C, provided the other requirements of § <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="internal">1003.2(o)</ref> are met.

                <content>General. Section 1003.3(c)(12) provides that an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> is an excluded transaction if a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> originated fewer than 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. For example, assume that a bank is a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> in 2022 under § <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="internal">1003.2(g)</ref> because it originated 50 <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loans</ref> in 2020, 75 <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loans</ref> in 2021, and met all of the other requirements under § <ref target="1003-2-g-1" reftype="internal">1003.2(g)(1)</ref>. Also assume that the bank originated 75 and 85 open-end lines of credit in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loans</ref> that the bank originated, or for which it received applications, during 2022 are <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loans</ref> and must be reported, unless they otherwise are excluded transactions under § <ref target="1003-3-c" reftype="internal">1003.3(c)</ref>. However, the open-end lines of credit that the bank originated, or for which it received applications, during 2022 are excluded transactions under § 1003.3(c)(12) and need not be reported.

              <content>Originations and applications involving more than one institution. Section 1003.4(a) requires a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> to collect certain information regarding applications for <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loans</ref> that it receives and regarding <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loans</ref> that it originates. The following provides guidance on how to report originations and applications involving more than one institution. The discussion below assumes that all of the parties are <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institutions</ref> as defined by § 1003.2(g). The same principles apply if any of the parties is not a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref>.

                <content>In contrast, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>, a purchase does not include a temporary transfer of a <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to an interim funder or warehouse creditor as part of an interim funding agreement under which the originating <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> is obligated to repurchase the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> for sale to a subsequent investor. Such agreements, often referred to as “repurchase agreements,” are sometimes employed as functional equivalents of warehouse lines of credit. Under these agreements, the interim funder or warehouse creditor acquires legal title to the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref>, subject to an obligation of the originating institution to repurchase at a future date, rather than taking a security interest in the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> as under the terms of a more conventional warehouse line of credit. To illustrate, assume <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A has an interim funding agreement with <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to enable <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to originate loans.

If an institution is required to report specific information about the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9), the institution reports the information that relates to the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9). For example, <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A originated a <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> that is secured by both property A and property B, each of which contains a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A reports the loan as one entry on its loan/application register, reporting the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for either property A or property B. If <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A elects to report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) about property A, <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A also reports the information required by § 1003.4(a)(5), (6), (14), (29), and (30) related to property A.

If an institution relies on only a portion of an applicant's income in its determination, it does not report that portion of income not relied on. For example, if an institution, pursuant to lender and investor guidelines, does not rely on an applicant's commission income because it has been earned for less than 12 months, the institution does not include the applicant's commission income in the income reported. Likewise, if an institution relies on the verified gross income of the applicant in making the credit decision, then the institution reports the verified gross income. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes the cosigner's income to the extent relied upon.

However, if the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> changes the promised rate to the rate that would have been available to the borrower under the new program on the date of the original rate-lock commitment, then that is the date the rate is set, provided the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> consistently follows that practice in all such cases or the original rate-lock agreement so provided. For example, assume that a borrower locks a rate of 2.5 percent on June 1 for a 30-year, variable-rate loan with a 5-year, fixed-rate introductory period. On June 15, the borrower decides to switch to a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, and the rate available to the borrower for that product on June 15 is 4.0 percent. On June 1, the 30-year, fixed-rate loan would have been available to the borrower at a rate of 3.5 percent. If the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> offers the borrower the 3.5 percent rate (i.e., the rate that would have been available to the borrower for the fixed-rate product on June 1, the date of the original rate-lock) because the original agreement so provided or because the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> consistently follows that practice for borrowers who change loan programs, then the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should use June 1 as the rate-set date. In all other cases, the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should use June 15 as the rate-set date.</content>

For <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loans</ref> purchased by a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref>, lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> at the time of purchase.

For example, assume that a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> originates a business-purpose transaction that is exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to <ref target="CFR:12-1026-3" reftype="external">12 CFR 1026.3</ref>(a)(1), to finance the purchase of a <ref target="1003-2-n" reftype="term">multifamily dwelling</ref>, and that there is a balloon payment, as defined by Regulation Z, <ref target="CFR:12-1026-18" reftype="external">12 CFR 1026.18</ref>(s)(5)(i), at the end of the loan term. The <ref target="1003-2-n" reftype="term">multifamily dwelling</ref> is a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="internal">1003.2(f)</ref>, but not under Regulation Z, <ref target="CFR:12-1026-2" reftype="external">12 CFR 1026.2</ref>(a)(19). In this example, the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should report the business-purpose transaction as having a balloon payment under § 1003.4(a)(27)(i), assuming the other requirements of this part are met. Aside from these distinctions, <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institutions</ref> may rely on the definitions and related commentary provided in the appropriate sections of Regulation Z referenced in § 1003.4(a)(27) of this part in determining whether the contractual feature should be reported.</content>

If the <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> for a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> changes (as a consequence of a merger or a change in the institution's charter, for example), the institution must identify its new <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> in its annual submission of data pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) for the year of the change. For example, if an institution's <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> changes in February 2018, it must identify its new <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> beginning with the annual submission of its 2018 data by March 1, 2019 pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i). For an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), the institution also must identify its new <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> in its quarterly submission of data pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) beginning with its submission for the quarter of the change, unless the change occurs during the fourth quarter. For example, if the <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> for an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) changes during February 2020, the institution must identify its new <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> beginning with its quarterly submission pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) for the first quarter of 2020. If the <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> for an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) changes during December 2020, the institution must identify its new <ref target="1003-5-a-4" reftype="term">appropriate Federal agency</ref> beginning with the annual submission of its 2020 data by March 1, 2021 pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i).</content>
