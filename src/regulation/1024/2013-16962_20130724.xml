The use of either the <ref target="1024-2-b-HUD" reftype="term">HUD</ref>-1 or <ref target="1024-2-b-HUD" reftype="term">HUD</ref>-1A is not mandatory for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans), as long as the provisions of <ref target="1024-2-b-RegulationZ" reftype="term">Regulation Z</ref> are followed.

            <content>Facts: A is an attorney who, as a part of his legal representation of clients in residential real estate transactions, orders and reviews title insurance policies for his clients. A enters into a contract with B, a <ref target="1024-2-b-TitleCompany" reftype="term">title company</ref>, to be an agent of B under a program set up by B. Under the agreement, A agrees to prepare and forward title insurance <ref target="1024-2-b-Application" reftype="term">applications</ref> to B, to re-examine the preliminary title commitment for accuracy and if he chooses to attempt to clear exceptions to the title policy before <ref target="1024-2-b-Settlement" reftype="term">closing</ref>. A agrees to assume liability for waiving certain exceptions to title, but never exercises this authority. B performs the necessary title search and examination work, determines insurability of title, prepares documents containing substantive information in title commitments, handles <ref target="1024-2-b-Settlement" reftype="term">closings</ref> for A's clients and issues title policies. A receives a fee from his client for legal services and an additional fee for his title agent “services” from the client's title insurance premium to B.</content>

            <content>Comments: A and B are violating section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref>. Here, A's clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a “title agent” is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services for which he assumes liability, and which includes at a minimum, the evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the <ref target="1024-2-b-TitleCompany" reftype="term">title company</ref>. A may not be compensated for the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the referral of <ref target="1024-2-b-SettlementService" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> business, it has violated section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref>.</content>

The payment of a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners, such arrangements would violate section 8.
